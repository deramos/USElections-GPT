### Analyzing and Predicting US Election Trends with RAG-enabled GPT

![Header Image](docs/img/background_image.png) 

This project leverages the power of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) 
in understanding, analyzing, and predicting trends in US elections. It does this by sourcing news articles from 
websites such as **FoxNews**, **CNN**, **NPR**, and **Politico** making sure that whether you are liberal or conservative, 
your political views can be represented in the answers generated by the LLM.

## Architecture Design
A simplified architecture diagram of the product is shown below:

#### SCRAPER SERVICE & MONGODB
First, news articles are scraped from news sources and loaded into MongoDB. To ensure that all sides of the political 
spectrum are represented in the LLM, right-winged and left-winged news sources as well as the middle ground are scraped.
Users can select which side of the political spectrum when querying the LLM.

#### AIRFLOW, NEWS SUMMARY, & NAMED ENTITY EXTRACTION
Airflow is used with papermill and jupyter notebook to summarize news articles using HuggingFace summarization pipeline,
extract named entities using spacy, and get vector embeddings using HuggingFace SentenceTransformer. The news articles,
their summaries, and extracted entities including _PERSON_, _ORG_, and _LOCATION_ are loaded into ChromaDB datastore.

#### REDIS CACHE
The news article URL is cached on redis to ensure that the webpage is visited and scraped once. 

#### CHAT SERVICE & LANGCHAIN
