    "# News Article Summarization. \n",
    "This notebook prepares news articles to be inserted into the ChromaDB vector database. First, it creates a summary of the news article, then it identifies important Named Entities such as the names of politicians, locations, and relevant dates. Having a news summary allows us to quickly perform small-to-big retrieval; finding the full article from it's brief overview. This method helps us evaluate the Language Learning Model (LLM) more effectively. Additionally, the identified entities will be used as metadata and embedded with the news articles, aiding in fine-tuning and evaluating the LLM.\n",

       "   '\\n            Still, there’s been a behind-the-scenes effort by bill supporters to launch a counter-campaign in response to TikTok’s lobbying blitz against the legislation. That includes scheduling a classified briefing for all House members at 1 p.m. Tuesday about the app’s potential national security threat.\\n    ',\n",

       "   '\\n            “Members have an opportunity to get this classified briefing from Department of Justice and other intelligence agencies around what they see as the threat of apps that are owned by foreign adversaries,” said McMorris Rodgers. “We’re working very hard to answer questions and continue to build support.”\\n    ',\n",
       "   '\\n            GOP Rep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia, an Energy and Commerce member, added: “If people take advantage of (the briefings), they’ll see things that the former president doesn’t currently have access to.”\\n    ',\n",
       "   '\\n            Rep. Jeff Duncan, a Freedom Caucus member who also sits on Energy and Commerce, told CNN he’s sought to educate Trump’s camp about what the bill would actually do.\\n    ',\n",

Just provide information and not anything contentious at all.”\\n    ',\n",
       "   '\\n            GOP Rep. Greg Pence of Indiana also said they are working to clear up misconceptions about the bill, which would give ByteDance 165 days to sell TikTok or else it would be banned from US app stores. Bill supporters have also been quick to point out that the bill does not require American ownership, just mandates that a foreign adversary can’t own it.\\n    ',\n",

The TikTok issue is pretty straightforward, it’s not even about TikTok. It’s about ensuring we’re protecting the data of the American people.”\\n    ',\n",
       "   '\\n            The Texas Republican continued: “We know what’s happening with Tik Tok and the Chinese Communist Party’s control of that, so we should address it. This bill is a good faith effort to do that without targeting them specifically.”\\n    ',\n",
       "   '\\n            House Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good said he is still evaluating the TikTok legislation but said he’s leaning voting in “favor” of it.\\xa0He also said Trump’s position has no impact on his decision.\\n    ',\n",

Troy Nehls, a staunch Trump ally, said he is against the app and its ties to China, but is still undecided on the bill – in part because he wants to hear out Trump first.\\n    ',\n",

Nancy Mace of South Carolina, for example, is scheduled to appear on “Real Time with Bill Maher” later this week. Meanwhile, when asked if he was attending, GOP Rep. Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota told CNN: “No way, I have to run for governor.” And Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee quipped:\\xa0“I don’t retreat, I move forward! I got a farm to run.”\\n    ',\n",
       "   '\\n            But privately, some Republicans have complained about the venue choice.

       "   '\\n            And other GOP lawmakers and aides told CNN they were simply not enthusiastic about the idea of having to huddle with the rest of their party at a time when Republican infighting has prevented them from even passing procedural votes.\\n    ',\n",
       "   '\\n            In a remarkable split screen, firebrand GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida will be attending a rally in Texas on Thursday in support of Brandon Herrera, a far-right candidate who is challenging GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales.\\n    ',\n",
       "   '\\n            In another hiccup for the retreat, the House GOP’s keynote speaker – Fox Business Host Larry Kudlow – had to drop out at the last minute, sources say.\\xa0Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, will take his place instead.\\n    ',\n",
       "   '\\n            Among the Republicans who have decided to skip the retreat include Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee; Reps.
