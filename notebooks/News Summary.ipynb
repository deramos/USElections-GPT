    "# News Article Summarization. \n",
    "This notebook prepares news articles to be inserted into the ChromaDB vector database. First, it creates a summary of the news article, then it identifies important Named Entities such as the names of politicians, locations, and relevant dates. Having a news summary allows us to quickly perform small-to-big retrieval; finding the full article from it's brief overview. This method helps us evaluate the Language Learning Model (LLM) more effectively. Additionally, the identified entities will be used as metadata and embedded with the news articles, aiding in fine-tuning and evaluating the LLM.\n",

       "'Sen. Joe Manchin, a critical swing vote in the closely divided Senate, said Wednesday that from now on, he will only vote to confirm nominees who have the support of at least one Republican senator.“I’m going to be very honest with everybody, if my Democratic colleagues and friends can’t get one Republican vote, don’t count on me. You can’t make it bipartisan, don’t count on me,” said the West Virginia Democrat who haswill begin in January 2025.“I’m not leaving this place unless I can practice what I preach and I’m preaching, basically bipartisanship,” he said. “This is my little way of doing it.”Manchin’s comments came in response to questions from CNN about President Joe Biden’s nominee for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Adeel Mangi, who would be the first Muslin-American on a federal appeals court. Many Republicans are vehemently opposed to him and accuse him having extreme views and part of a group they call antisemitic. Top Democrats strongly defend him and are pressing for a floor vote, after he was narrowly approved in the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, although they acknowledge not knowing if they have the votes to confirm him.On Thursday, Manchin confirmed he would vote against Mangi.One Democrat, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, announced her opposition to Mangi on Tuesday.Sen Lisa Murkowski, a centrist Republican from Alaska who often votes across the aisle, told CNN Wednesday she needs to examine Mangi’s record before deciding how she will vote.For Manchin, he said Wednesday there is one exception to his newly announced requirement of bipartisanship: “That’s my requirement unless they’re bats*** crazy. If they’re bats*** crazy left, I’m gonna vote against them anyway. If they’re halfway decent, they’ll get at least one Republican to vote for them.”Asked if he still sees a viable path for Mangi to be confirmed, Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said, “it certainly is going to be a challenge with the many things people are saying,” referring to vocal opposition to Mangi.© 2024 Cable News Network.

       "  ['Whichwill Americans see for theIs it the vigorous, smiling president who tangled with Republicans in real time during the high-wire act of a nationally televised address Thursday?Or is it the “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” who a special counsel determined would be too sympathetic to prosecute for mishandling classified data and will be described in?The thundering grandfather is hitting the road, taking his State of the Union persona to a monthlong tour of swing states in the hopes of inspiring Democrats to get involved in the election. First up, campaign rallies in theon Friday and theon Saturday – urban centers in states Biden narrowly won in 2020. His campaign is also launching ad campaigns to target Black and Hispanic audiences as well as March Madness viewers.Meanwhile, Robert Hur, the special counsel, will be testifying on Capitol Hill about his impression of Biden’s memory lapses during the investigation into classified material (mostly in handwritten notebooks) found in Biden’s Delaware garage and elsewhere.The other recent example of a forceful Biden moment came after Hur released his report in February absolving the president of criminal wrongdoing but also revealing that investigators found his “memory was significantly limited” during interviews, with the report noting that Biden could not remember when his son died. Bidenat a hastily called White House news conference.It’s hard to square the wildly different impressions being pushed at voters:► If State of the Union Biden is the real deal, why have his advisers not done more to stop the doddering old man perception from festering?► If he can respond to hecklers in real time during the State of the Union address, why does he not do more interviews? He skipped the opportunity to do a, for instance, and instead released a produced video about the cost of chips and ice cream on social media.► If he can gladhand on the House floor long after his speech ends, why hasn’t he been more visibly present on the campaign trail? Candidate Biden didthe possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza on the sidelines of a trip to get ice cream with the late night host Seth Meyers in New York City.► If he can deliver effective warnings about former President Donald Trump in the House chamber, why does he more frequently say these things?Vice President Kamala Harris would not commit Friday that Biden would take part in debates with former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. The administration will “get to that,” she told ABC News, pointing instead to the policy ideas Biden put forward in his Thursday speech – protecting democracy, lowering prescription drug costs, raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing paid family leave.“At this moment in time when we’re looking at the split screen and the fact that Donald Trump is on the other side, I think that’s an important point for the American people,” she said.Biden said his goal in the speech was to “wake up Congress.” The more important achievement may be demonstrating to the country that he is indeed awake and capable.The surprise effect of his energetic State of the Union performance has also allowed some interesting comments that might otherwise have gained more attention to slide past.Biden used the derogatory and dehumanizing term “illegal” to refer to the man accused of killing Laken Riley, the nursing student in Georgia who was found dead last month and whose case has been seized on by conservatives, many of whom wore pins bearing her name during the speech.“(Laken) Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal,” Biden said, as he called on Republicans to pass a. Note: Jose Ibarra, a Venezuelan who police say crossed the border illegally, has been accused of the crime but not convicted.His attempt to triangulate toward Republicans on their signature border issue is turning off some Democrats.“The rhetoric President Biden used tonight was dangerously close to language from Donald Trump that puts a target on the backs of Latinos everywhere,” the Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro from Texas said on X.Biden’s own administration made a show of officially ending use of the term “illegal alien” in US immigration enforcement agencies’ official communications.After the speech, on the House floor, when Biden thought he could not be heard by microphones, he was approached by Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who asked him to keep pressing Israel on allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza.Biden said he would have a “come to Jesus meeting” with Bibi, the nickname for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an incredible way to phrase any kind of meeting with the leader of the Jewish state. Plus, while that kind of candor might be exactly the sentiment a lot of Democrats concerned about Palestinians want to hear about Israel, it’s much further than Biden is willing to go in public.Speaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews, Biden declined to elaborate on the hot-mic moment.“I didn’t say that in the speech,” he said, adding: “You guys (are) eavesdropping on things.”Biden’s desire to maintain some discipline around a public message is a contrast with Trump, who thrives on saying shocking things in public, be it at a campaign rally or from outside a courtroom.The puzzle Biden and his campaign must solve is how to maintain momentum from a speech that will mostly be forgotten in the coming weeks.© 2024 Cable News Network.

       "  ['Congress is running up on yet another critical government funding deadline on March 22, with one week to go before the potential, partial shutdown of several critical departments.Negotiators are still working furiously around the clock to finish their work on the remaining six bills.And so the federal government has once more begun the mandatory process of planning to bring the affected agencies’ nonessential functions to a halt one week from Friday.“One week prior to the expiration of appropriations bills, regardless of whether the enactment of appropriations appears imminent, OMB will communicate with agency senior officials to remind agencies of their responsibilities to review and update orderly shutdown plans, and will share a draft communication template to notify employees of the status of appropriations,” a document from the White House Office of Management and Budget states.If this feels familiar, that’s becausethat lawmakers have run up against a funding deadline, passing stopgap bills in the nick of time in September, November, January and earlier this month to keep the government running.Congress passed aahead of another partial deadline earlier this month, providing funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.But funding for the remaining departments and agencies expires at the end of the day March 22. That includes the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, State, Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education and Labor. A series of sticking points remain including over funding for DHS.Millions of federal workers and military personnel would be affected by the shutdown, including about 60% of civilian federal employees, according to Andrew Lautz, senior policy analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center.At least 625,000 workers, mostly civilian Defense Department employees, could be subject to furlough, he said. At least another 725,000 civilian federal employees, mainly in the departments of Homeland Security and Defense, could have to continue working, but not get paid until the shutdown ends, Lautz said.And just over 2 million military personnel, including active duty and selected reserve members, couldalso have work without pay.With the clock ticking and thorny issues remaining, here’s what could happen in the absence of a deal:The Department of Homeland Security oversees a number of critical functions, including transportation security, border security and disaster relief. According to shutdown guidance, a vast majority of the department’s workforce of 258,052 federal employees are designated as exempt from a shutdown and would remain at work without pay (229,844).Transportation Security Administration personnel would be among the DHS employees working without pay, which could create headaches and delays for travelers at airports. During the 2019 shutdown, hundreds of TSA officers called out from work – many of them to find other ways to make money.US Border Patrol agents are also considered essential and would continue to perform their law enforcement functions, including apprehending migrants crossing the border unlawfully, during a government shutdown – but without pay. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would also continue its law enforcement duties.An estimated 60,411 Customs and Border Protection personnel are expected to remain working during a lapse in appropriations and estimated 16,764 employees will be considered exempt or excepted at ICE in the event of a shutdown, according to a DHS document detailing the agency’s procedures.US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which also falls under DHS and is tasked with processing asylum claims, would continue work that’s fee-funded.Even though border authorities would keep working, a shutdown could harm other operations.In previous shutdowns, for example, the Department of Homeland Security was forced to delay maintenance of facilities, “which had a serious impact on law enforcement officer operations and safety, including at the border,” according to a 2019 congressional report that reviewed the cost of past government shutdowns.“The lack of these critical maintenance and repair services endangered the lives of law enforcement officers and created significant border security vulnerabilities,” the report said.More than 2 million US military personnel continue their duties during a shutdown, but they could potentially work without pay. It would depend in part on whether Congress would pass legislation similar to the one it approved prior to the 2013 shutdown that guaranteed that the military would be paid during the impasse.And the Department of Defense’s robust civilian workforce supporting service members’ efforts is impacted. About 45% of the civilian workforce of more than 800,000 employees would be furloughed.“The department will continue to defend the nation and conduct ongoing military operations,” afrom the Pentagon most recently updated in November said.A potential shutdown would come at a critical moment for a number of crises abroad. Department officials have repeatedly warned that cuts would need to be made that would impact the US response.“If we don’t have the support of Congress, if we don’t have a budget, if we continue to operate under a continuing resolution, if we don’t get our supplemental passed, no, things are not going to be sustainable,” Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh recently told reporters. “We are going to have to look to make cuts to continue to fund our operations in the CENTCOM AOR, to continue to support Ukraine.”And while defense contracts awarded prior to a shutdown continue, the department’s guidance states that “new contracts may not be executed.”The White House has also previously warned that a lapse in funding could lead to a disruption in military recruitment efforts.About one-third of the State Department’s employees are required to work during a potential shutdown, according to guidance from the department updated in November. All US embassies and consulates abroad “will be operational for national security reasons,” and the department will continue operations supporting passports, visas and assisting US citizens abroad.But any new State Department grants and contracts will be ceased, with the exception of those that “protect life and property, and for reasons essential to national security.” New job offers to prospective Civil Service members will be halted – potentially having long-term effects for recruitment. And any new, official travel that does not fulfill a national security purpose would stop, according to the department’s guidance.The Treasury Department updated on Friday the contingency plan for the Internal Revenue Service, which is in the middle of the tax filing season. It notes that the IRS has multiyear funding under the Inflation Reduction Act that it can use to continue processing returns to the extent necessary to protect government property, including tax revenue, as well as continue implementing theand the act’s green energy provisions. Audit functions, however, would cease during a shutdown.A little fewer than half of the agency’s nearly 90,000 employees would continue working during a shutdown.IRS employees are busyfor the season, which ends April 15 for most taxpayers. The agency expects nearly 129 million returns to be filed by the deadline.The IRS has never experienced a shutdown during the filing season, Commissioner Danny Werfel told reporters in January, shortly before an earlier potential shutdown that Congress averted through. The agency would do what it could to minimize disruptions, he said at the time.In 2019, theon record ended on January 25, and the tax filing season started on January 28.During the first week of a lapse in funding, the Department of Education would furlough 89% of its total staff, according to thelast updated in September.Some key operations would be able to continue for a “limited time,” including the disbursement of federal student loans and grants and the processing of the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid. The department is currently working on processing FAFSA applications for students who have applied for financial aid for the upcoming 2024-25 academic year. Financial aid award letters have already beenafter the bumpy rollout of anBut the department warned in September that, at some point, processing FAFSA forms and disbursing federal student aid “could also experience some level of disruption due to a lapse.”The agency also warned that a lapse in funding beyond one week “would severely curtail the cash flow to school districts, colleges and universities, vocational rehabilitation agencies, and other entities that depend on the Department’s discretionary funds to support their services.”Additionally, the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights would have to pause its work to review and investigate civil rights complaints during a lapse in funding. The office has launched a number of investigations intoamid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.About 4,100 of the Labor Department’s roughly 15,500 employees would be retained if the federal government shuts down, according to the agency’s contingency plan that was filed in January. Nine agencies, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Veterans Employment and Training Service, would cease operations until funding is restored. The lack of, unemployment,and other data from the bureau would make it harder to gauge the status of the nation’s economy.The department would continue several significant activities, including worker protection activities funded through other resources, worker benefits under entitlement programs and the protection of life and property in cases of imminent threat. For example, agencies would monitor and respond to child labor investigations and process disaster recovery grant applications for dislocated workers. The department also would continue to support states in the administration and payment of unemployment benefits.However, it would cease many worker protection agency investigations funded with annual appropriations unless they involve responding to or preventing fatalities, catastrophes or imminent danger. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration would not conduct any programmed inspections and suspend most compliance and technical assistance, outreach programs and training classes, among other activities.The Department of Health and Human Services would furlough 45% of its employees, or nearly 40,000 people, if the government shuts down, according to the contingency plan the agency filed last year. More than 49,000 employees would be retained, and the majority of them would continue to be paid through mandatory, multi-year, carryover or user fee funds.But its top priority during a funding lapse is “to protect the health of Americans,” the plan said. For instance, the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, which is devoted to research, will continue to admit and care for patients from whom it is medically necessary. The Administration for Children and Families will continue to support kids in the Unaccompanied Children program. The Food and Drug Administration will continue to respond to emergencies, including outbreaks related to foodborne illnesses and the flu, product recalls and the screening of imported food and medical products. The 988/Suicide Lifeline will continue to operate.© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.'],\n",
       "  ['A critical US partner in northwest Africa is turning toward Russia amid warnings from the top US commander in the continent that the Russians are trying to “take over” the entire Sahel region of Africa.Niger, which has served as a crucial foothold for US counterterrorism operations in the region for nearly a decade,that it was ending the accord that has allowed US military personnel and civilian staff to operate in the country since 2014.The announcement came days after a tense meeting between Niger’s military junta, which seized power in a, and US diplomatic and military officials including Gen. Michael Langley, commander of US Africa Command, and  Celeste Wallander, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, defense officials told CNN. In that meeting, the US delegation expressed concern about the escalating Russian military presence in Niger, officials said, and particularly about the future of Air Base 101 in Niger’s capital and whether it will be ceded to the Russians, officials said.The discussion angered the junta leaders, who felt like they were being lectured to, despite the US cutting off much of its military and foreign assistance to Niger late last year following the coup.“When it comes to choosing diplomatic, strategic and military partners, the government of Niger regrets the willingness of the American delegation to deny the sovereign people of Niger the right to choose its partners and the types of partnerships likely to help it to truly fight terrorism, even though the United States of America has unilaterally decided to suspend all cooperation between our two countries,” Col. Maj. Amadou Abdramane, a Nigerien military spokesman, said in a statement Saturday, adding that the US delegation had a “condescending attitude” toward the Nigeriens.Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed on Monday that the US delegation “expressed concern over Niger’s potential relationships with Russia” as well as with Iran.“We raised our concerns in a direct and frank manner,” she said.The intensifying military cooperation between Russia and Niger is central to the dispute between the US and the Nigerien junta, officials said. Russia and Niger agreed to strengthen their military ties in January, Russia’s Defense Ministry said at the time.Still, while US counterterrorism operations and training with the Nigerien military largely paused after the coup, the junta did not ask the US to leave, even after kicking out French troops and cutting remaining ties with the EU in late 2023.Several of the junta leaders have worked with and been trained by the US as part of the US’ security cooperation with the country over the years. And the Pentagon has been eager to keep a force presence in the country, with many administration officialsto tackle terrorism in the region and arguing that it’s feasible even amid the political turmoil there.Now, however, there is concern among US military officials that with Russia’s increasing presence in Niger, the Kremlin has established another foothold in the Sahel region and the West is losing its influence, a military source with knowledge of the situation said.Langley, the AFRICOM commander,that the US has been “drowned out” by Russian disinformation across Africa in previous years, leading to Russia’s success in stoking “a lot of the instability across the Sahel.”He added that both Russia and China “want that ground. They want power projection capabilities. … But I think at [an] accelerated pace, the Russian Federation is really trying to take over Central Africa as well as the Sahel.”State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Saturday that the US remains in touch with the junta, which calls itself the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland, or CNSP.“We are aware of the statement from the CNSP in Niger, which follows frank discussions at senior levels in Niamey this week about our concerns with the CNSP’s trajectory,” Miller said in a statement. “We are in touch with the CNSP and will provide further updates as warranted.”It is not yet clear whether the military junta in Niger will actually force the US military to leave the country, where US forces have conducted anti-terror operations and trained the Nigerien military since 2014.If the US were forced to withdraw, counterterrorism efforts across the region could take a hit, officials said. US drone flights out of an air base in Agadez,Niger, have given the US the ability to monitor threats in the Sahel region from a relatively close and stable position, especially as violent terror organizations have carried out a growing number of attacks in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso.Officials are also concerned that withdrawing the approximately 650 US troops stationed in Niger could leave a vacuum that Islamist militants and Russian mercenaries, including what’s left of, would try to exploit.Russia has kept its sights on Niger as the US-Nigerien relationship has deteriorated. In December, the Kremlin reopened its embassy in neighboring Burkina Faso, positioning itself closer to the capital of Niger, and it has increased its effort to court Niger’s military junta, a senior intelligence official told CNN.Part of the appeal for Niger is that Russia can offer to sell its own weapons and equipment without the same conditions to respect human rights and abide by international law that the US calls for, the official said. And, for a country looking for an immediate supply of military hardware, Russia is able to sell its weapons much faster than the United States. In return, Russia is profiting off the region’s natural resources, another official said, including the gold mines in Niger.Abdramane, the Nigerien military spokesman, said Saturday that Russia “is a partner with which Niger deals on a state-to-state basis, in accordance with military cooperation agreements signed with the previous government, to acquire military equipment necessary to its fight against the terrorists who have claimed thousands of innocent Nigerian victims under the indifferent eye of much of the international community.”The US-Nigerien relationship has gone downhill quickly. Late last year, the US believed the junta government was in a “better place,” according to the senior intelligence official, and was refocusing on countering the rise of violent extremist organizations in Western Africa. The groups include ISIS-Sahel and Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam Wal-Musliminim, more commonly known as JNIM, a radical Islamist organization operating in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.A reduction in US surveillance missions in the region following the coup in Niger gave ISIS-Sahel and JNIM an opportunity to expand, the official said. But even with cooperation between the US and Niger reduced, the US military’s goal remained the same: to provide support to counter the spread of extremist organizations. Several European countries shared this goal, offering a measure of support to the junta, the official noted.But with Russia exerting more pressure and the US limited in what it can provide to Niger by law because of the coup designation, the Nigerien government has been cracking down even harder on the remaining Western military presence in the country, the sources said. US operations in the country require stricter Nigerien oversight and approval, even as the Russian presence in the country has grown increasingly visible.“Northwest Africa is getting carved up in real time by half a dozen or more countries,” one of the officials said, “and the United States is losing its foothold.”© 2024 Cable News Network.

       "  ['The US transferred thousands of machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition seized from Iran tolast week, US Central Command announced on Tuesday.Ukraine has been suffering from shortages of weapons and munitions on the battlefield in its war against Russia, with the US unable to send more equipment from its own stockpiles.CENTCOM said the materiel transferred to Ukraine is enough to equip one Ukrainian brigade — around 4,000 personnel — with small-arms rifles. “These weapons will help Ukraine defend against Russia’s invasion,” CENTCOM said in a statement.The munitions were originally seized by the US military and its partners “from four separate transiting stateless vessels between 22 May 2021 to 15 Feb 2023,” but the US government did not obtain ownership of the equipment via the Justice Department’s civil forfeiture process until December of last year, CENTCOM said.It is not the first time the US has transferred seized Iranian military equipment to the Ukrainians. The US transferred over one million rounds of seized Iranian ammunition to the Ukrainian armed forces in October,Over the past year, the US Navy has seized thousands of Iranian assault rifles and more than one million rounds of ammunition from vessels used by Iran to ship weapons to the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The seizures, frequently carried out with regional partner forces, target small stateless vessels on routes historically used to smuggle weapons to the Houthis.For the last year, the Biden administration has been working to legally send the seized weapons, which are stored in CENTCOM facilities across the Middle East, to the Ukrainians.© 2024 Cable News Network.

Primaries on Tuesday may offer the final opportunity for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s quixotic and lackluster effort to challenge Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.Instead of a single primary or caucus, Super Tuesday lumps together 15 contests for Republicans and 16 contests for Democrats spread across the country.More than a third ofare at stake along with an equally large portion of Democratic delegates. Biden is undefeated in primary contests this year, and Trump has lost only one.A large sample of the country will have contests on Super Tuesday – red states and blue states from the North, South, East and West.The primaries at stake include the first three states in the alphabet, as any schoolkid should be able to tell you: Alabama, Alaska (for Republicans) and Arkansas. In addition, there are California and Colorado; Maine, Massachusetts and Minnesota; North Carolina; Oklahoma; Tennessee and Texas; Utah; and Vermont and Virginia.Tuesday also marks the end of Democrats’ mail-in presidential preference process in Iowa, and a Democratic caucus in American Samoa.In 2016, Super Tuesday was the moment when Trump really seized control of the Republican primary. Trump won seven of the 11 contests that day, although he lost the largest prize, Texas. There was still a spirited race for delegates in 2016, as opposed to this year, when Trump has won nearly every contest before Super Tuesday and has a growing delegate lead over Haley.In 2020, Biden won 10 of 14 contests on Super Tuesday. He has not faced any serious competition from Democrats this year and is expected, as is traditional for incumbents, to win every contest Tuesday.For Republicans, the question is whether Haley can gain any traction. She has won only one contest – the primary in Washington, DC,. She is falling far behind in terms of delegates, but Haley insists that Republicans deserve a second option.Barring some unforeseen eruption of support for Haley, will a setback on Super Tuesday push her out of the race?For Democrats, Biden is coming off a. He won the Democratic primary there easily, but more than 100,000 Democratic primary voters chose “uncommitted” rather than Biden. “Uncommitted” won two of Michigan’s delegates, the only delegates Biden has lost so far.As the Palestinian, the Democratic primary voters in a state with a strong Arab American and Muslim population were protesting the president’s Israel policy and want him to push much more forcefully for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

       "  ['Senior US officials, Americans who had returned from detention abroad and loved ones of those who have yet to come home gathered in front of the US State Department as a new flag was raised ahead of the nation’s first-ever Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day.“This is a solemn day,” Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Friday as he stood before the flag, bearing the words “bring them home” and dozens of tally marks.“Today’s ceremony is a solemn recognition of those who have returned home, those who regrettably never will, and those still being held captive abroad,” he said, adding that it was “an opportunity to recommit ourselves – to truly recommit ourselves – to stand united against the scourge of hostage diplomacy, and to reaffirm the principles of peace, justice and human dignity for all.”“The State Department will solemnly raise the flag each year and whenever a hostage or wrongfully detained returns from abroad or dies in captivity,” Campbell said.Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day will be annually recognized on March 9 – the date on which former FBI agent Robert Levinson was abducted in Iran 17 years ago. Levinson isHis family members are strong advocates for the hostage and detainee community, and legislation on wrongful detention has been named in his honor.Speaking outside the State Department Friday, Campbell vowed to the loved ones of those still held abroad: “The United States government is with you and we will work tirelessly until you are reunited with your loved ones.”However, for some, the message rang hollow. As the years have gone by with few apparent updates and little to no public acknowledgment by the US government, these families say they fear that their loved ones cases’ are not being made a priority.“We do feel invisible,” said Maryam Kamalmaz, whosewas detained in Syria in February 2017. He hasn’t been heard from since.Kamalmaz is among the family members who have called on President Joe Biden to meet with them – a request that has not yet been granted.After the flag raising Friday, they gathered in Lafayette Park in front of the White House to once again plead their case.“We are sick and tired. Sick and tired of standing in front of the White House, having to travel across the country to DC, to the doorstep of President Biden, begging with him to just meet with us. Even for only five minutes,” said Harrison Li, whose father“We were here in December, sitting in this park, begging for President Biden to see us for a few minutes to talk about our loved ones,” said Aida Dagher, the sister-in-law of Zack Shahin, imprisoned in the United Arab Emirates. “The next morning, he met with the families of Gaza hostages. We’re very happy for them. We’re not jealous. But treat us all equally.”US officials have repeatedly said that a meeting with the president is not necessary to ensure that their loved ones’ cases are being worked on and it does not expedite someone’s release.“We know the president has met with some families and not all of them have come home,” Li said.“We know it’s not easy. There’s no magic button,” he said. “But at the same time, if the president doesn’t even hear from us, doesn’t know the names of our loved ones or isn’t reminded of it, he’s not going to be able to do anything.”US officials say that bringing home Americans wrongfully held abroad is a top priority. In his State of the Union address Thursday, Biden said the US will “work around the clock to bring home Evan (Gershkovich) and Paul (Whelan) — Americans being unjustly detained by the Russians — and others around the world.”Whelanthat he would like to speak with Biden, to “remind the President and the National Security Council that I’m still here, being held hostage by the Russian government, and the Biden administration has got to take decisive action to secure my release.”“If they don’t do anything, I’m stuck here. And if I’m stuck here, I die here,” he said.© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.'],\n",
       "  ['It’s an important new phase of, when the early contests are over and voters from multiple states cast ballots in primaries timed to occur on the same date.It’s called “Super Tuesday,” and it is important even though neither Democratic President Joe Biden nor former President Donald Trump has had to sweat the competition this year. Primaries on Tuesday may offer the final opportunity for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s quixotic and lackluster effort to challenge Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.Instead of a single primary or caucus, Super Tuesday lumps together 15 contests for Republicans and 16 contests for Democrats spread across the country.More than a third ofare at stake along with an equally large portion of Democratic delegates. Biden is undefeated in primary contests this year, and Trump has lost only one.A large sample of the country will have contests on Super Tuesday – red states and blue states from the North, South, East and West.The primaries at stake include the first three states in the alphabet, as any schoolkid should be able to tell you: Alabama, Alaska (for Republicans) and Arkansas. In addition, there are California and Colorado; Maine, Massachusetts and Minnesota; North Carolina; Oklahoma; Tennessee and Texas; Utah; and Vermont and Virginia.Tuesday also marks the end of Democrats’ mail-in presidential preference process in Iowa, and a Democratic caucus in American Samoa.In 2016, Super Tuesday was the moment when Trump really seized control of the Republican primary. Trump won seven of the 11 contests that day, although he lost the largest prize, Texas. There was still a spirited race for delegates in 2016, as opposed to this year, when Trump has won nearly every contest before Super Tuesday and has a growing delegate lead over Haley.In 2020, Biden won 10 of 14 contests on Super Tuesday. He has not faced any serious competition from Democrats this year and is expected, as is traditional for incumbents, to win every contest Tuesday.For Republicans, the question is whether Haley can gain any traction. She has won only one contest – the primary in Washington, DC,. She is falling far behind in terms of delegates, but Haley insists that Republicans deserve a second option.Barring some unforeseen eruption of support for Haley, will a setback on Super Tuesday push her out of the race?For Democrats, Biden is coming off a. He won the Democratic primary there easily, but more than 100,000 Democratic primary voters chose “uncommitted” rather than Biden. “Uncommitted” won two of Michigan’s delegates, the only delegates Biden has lost so far.As the Palestinian, the Democratic primary voters in a state with a strong Arab American and Muslim population were protesting the president’s Israel policy and want him to push much more forcefully for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Are there signs of more protest on Super Tuesday?Meanwhile, neither of the Democrats challenging Biden has gained much traction. Rep. Dean Phillips has failed to get out of the single digits in states where Biden has campaigned. One former, fringe rival, Marianne Williamson, has actually taken the unusual step of unsuspending her campaign.Not technically on Super Tuesday.

       "  ['The US transferred thousands of machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition seized from Iran tolast week, US Central Command announced on Tuesday.Ukraine has been suffering from shortages of weapons and munitions on the battlefield in its war against Russia, with the US unable to send more equipment from its own stockpiles.CENTCOM said the materiel transferred to Ukraine is enough to equip one Ukrainian brigade — around 4,000 personnel — with small-arms rifles. “These weapons will help Ukraine defend against Russia’s invasion,” CENTCOM said in a statement.The munitions were originally seized by the US military and its partners “from four separate transiting stateless vessels between 22 May 2021 to 15 Feb 2023,” but the US government did not obtain ownership of the equipment via the Justice Department’s civil forfeiture process until December of last year, CENTCOM said.It is not the first time the US has transferred seized Iranian military equipment to the Ukrainians. The US transferred over one million rounds of seized Iranian ammunition to the Ukrainian armed forces in October,Over the past year, the US Navy has seized thousands of Iranian assault rifles and more than one million rounds of ammunition from vessels used by Iran to ship weapons to the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The seizures, frequently carried out with regional partner forces, target small stateless vessels on routes historically used to smuggle weapons to the Houthis.For the last year, the Biden administration has been working to legally send the seized weapons, which are stored in CENTCOM facilities across the Middle East, to the Ukrainians.© 2024 Cable News Network.

       "  ['Congress is running up on yet another critical government funding deadline on March 22, with one week to go before the potential, partial shutdown of several critical departments.Negotiators are still working furiously around the clock to finish their work on the remaining six bills.And so the federal government has once more begun the mandatory process of planning to bring the affected agencies’ nonessential functions to a halt one week from Friday.“One week prior to the expiration of appropriations bills, regardless of whether the enactment of appropriations appears imminent, OMB will communicate with agency senior officials to remind agencies of their responsibilities to review and update orderly shutdown plans, and will share a draft communication template to notify employees of the status of appropriations,” a document from the White House Office of Management and Budget states.If this feels familiar, that’s becausethat lawmakers have run up against a funding deadline, passing stopgap bills in the nick of time in September, November, January and earlier this month to keep the government running.Congress passed aahead of another partial deadline earlier this month, providing funding for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development as well as the Food and Drug Administration, military construction and other federal programs.But funding for the remaining departments and agencies expires at the end of the day March 22. That includes the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, State, Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education and Labor. A series of sticking points remain including over funding for DHS.Millions of federal workers and military personnel would be affected by the shutdown, including about 60% of civilian federal employees, according to Andrew Lautz, senior policy analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center.At least 625,000 workers, mostly civilian Defense Department employees, could be subject to furlough, he said. At least another 725,000 civilian federal employees, mainly in the departments of Homeland Security and Defense, could have to continue working, but not get paid until the shutdown ends, Lautz said.And just over 2 million military personnel, including active duty and selected reserve members, couldalso have work without pay.With the clock ticking and thorny issues remaining, here’s what could happen in the absence of a deal:The Department of Homeland Security oversees a number of critical functions, including transportation security, border security and disaster relief. According to shutdown guidance, a vast majority of the department’s workforce of 258,052 federal employees are designated as exempt from a shutdown and would remain at work without pay (229,844).Transportation Security Administration personnel would be among the DHS employees working without pay, which could create headaches and delays for travelers at airports. During the 2019 shutdown, hundreds of TSA officers called out from work – many of them to find other ways to make money.US Border Patrol agents are also considered essential and would continue to perform their law enforcement functions, including apprehending migrants crossing the border unlawfully, during a government shutdown – but without pay. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would also continue its law enforcement duties.An estimated 60,411 Customs and Border Protection personnel are expected to remain working during a lapse in appropriations and estimated 16,764 employees will be considered exempt or excepted at ICE in the event of a shutdown, according to a DHS document detailing the agency’s procedures.US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which also falls under DHS and is tasked with processing asylum claims, would continue work that’s fee-funded.Even though border authorities would keep working, a shutdown could harm other operations.In previous shutdowns, for example, the Department of Homeland Security was forced to delay maintenance of facilities, “which had a serious impact on law enforcement officer operations and safety, including at the border,” according to a 2019 congressional report that reviewed the cost of past government shutdowns.“The lack of these critical maintenance and repair services endangered the lives of law enforcement officers and created significant border security vulnerabilities,” the report said.More than 2 million US military personnel continue their duties during a shutdown, but they could potentially work without pay. It would depend in part on whether Congress would pass legislation similar to the one it approved prior to the 2013 shutdown that guaranteed that the military would be paid during the impasse.And the Department of Defense’s robust civilian workforce supporting service members’ efforts is impacted. About 45% of the civilian workforce of more than 800,000 employees would be furloughed.“The department will continue to defend the nation and conduct ongoing military operations,” afrom the Pentagon most recently updated in November said.A potential shutdown would come at a critical moment for a number of crises abroad. Department officials have repeatedly warned that cuts would need to be made that would impact the US response.“If we don’t have the support of Congress, if we don’t have a budget, if we continue to operate under a continuing resolution, if we don’t get our supplemental passed, no, things are not going to be sustainable,” Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh recently told reporters. “We are going to have to look to make cuts to continue to fund our operations in the CENTCOM AOR, to continue to support Ukraine.”And while defense contracts awarded prior to a shutdown continue, the department’s guidance states that “new contracts may not be executed.”The White House has also previously warned that a lapse in funding could lead to a disruption in military recruitment efforts.About one-third of the State Department’s employees are required to work during a potential shutdown, according to guidance from the department updated in November. All US embassies and consulates abroad “will be operational for national security reasons,” and the department will continue operations supporting passports, visas and assisting US citizens abroad.But any new State Department grants and contracts will be ceased, with the exception of those that “protect life and property, and for reasons essential to national security.” New job offers to prospective Civil Service members will be halted – potentially having long-term effects for recruitment. And any new, official travel that does not fulfill a national security purpose would stop, according to the department’s guidance.The Treasury Department updated on Friday the contingency plan for the Internal Revenue Service, which is in the middle of the tax filing season. It notes that the IRS has multiyear funding under the Inflation Reduction Act that it can use to continue processing returns to the extent necessary to protect government property, including tax revenue, as well as continue implementing theand the act’s green energy provisions. Audit functions, however, would cease during a shutdown.A little fewer than half of the agency’s nearly 90,000 employees would continue working during a shutdown.IRS employees are busyfor the season, which ends April 15 for most taxpayers. The agency expects nearly 129 million returns to be filed by the deadline.The IRS has never experienced a shutdown during the filing season, Commissioner Danny Werfel told reporters in January, shortly before an earlier potential shutdown that Congress averted through. The agency would do what it could to minimize disruptions, he said at the time.In 2019, theon record ended on January 25, and the tax filing season started on January 28.During the first week of a lapse in funding, the Department of Education would furlough 89% of its total staff, according to thelast updated in September.Some key operations would be able to continue for a “limited time,” including the disbursement of federal student loans and grants and the processing of the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid. The department is currently working on processing FAFSA applications for students who have applied for financial aid for the upcoming 2024-25 academic year. Financial aid award letters have already beenafter the bumpy rollout of anBut the department warned in September that, at some point, processing FAFSA forms and disbursing federal student aid “could also experience some level of disruption due to a lapse.”The agency also warned that a lapse in funding beyond one week “would severely curtail the cash flow to school districts, colleges and universities, vocational rehabilitation agencies, and other entities that depend on the Department’s discretionary funds to support their services.”Additionally, the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights would have to pause its work to review and investigate civil rights complaints during a lapse in funding. The office has launched a number of investigations intoamid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.About 4,100 of the Labor Department’s roughly 15,500 employees would be retained if the federal government shuts down, according to the agency’s contingency plan that was filed in January. Nine agencies, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Veterans Employment and Training Service, would cease operations until funding is restored. The lack of, unemployment,and other data from the bureau would make it harder to gauge the status of the nation’s economy.The department would continue several significant activities, including worker protection activities funded through other resources, worker benefits under entitlement programs and the protection of life and property in cases of imminent threat. For example, agencies would monitor and respond to child labor investigations and process disaster recovery grant applications for dislocated workers. The department also would continue to support states in the administration and payment of unemployment benefits.However, it would cease many worker protection agency investigations funded with annual appropriations unless they involve responding to or preventing fatalities, catastrophes or imminent danger. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration would not conduct any programmed inspections and suspend most compliance and technical assistance, outreach programs and training classes, among other activities.The Department of Health and Human Services would furlough 45% of its employees, or nearly 40,000 people, if the government shuts down, according to the contingency plan the agency filed last year. More than 49,000 employees would be retained, and the majority of them would continue to be paid through mandatory, multi-year, carryover or user fee funds.But its top priority during a funding lapse is “to protect the health of Americans,” the plan said. For instance, the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, which is devoted to research, will continue to admit and care for patients from whom it is medically necessary. The Administration for Children and Families will continue to support kids in the Unaccompanied Children program. The Food and Drug Administration will continue to respond to emergencies, including outbreaks related to foodborne illnesses and the flu, product recalls and the screening of imported food and medical products. The 988/Suicide Lifeline will continue to operate.© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.'],\n",
       "  ['Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump already effectively sealed their party’s nominations on Super Tuesday. They’re both likely to reach the magic number of delegates in contests on March 12. But Americans across the country will continue to take part in the primary process until the final contests in June.Winning individual primaries and caucuses is just one step in the long path to winning a party’s presidential nomination. That process will continue to play out even though the outcome is assured. This story looks specifically at the Republican process, where there was more competition early in the race.How does the Republican Party pick a presidential candidate, in a nutshell?Both parties hold conventions in the summer where delegates technically select the nominee. The process and rules are different for each party, but the primaries are about winning enough delegates to secure the nomination.There are different kinds of nominating contests and different kinds of delegates in athat stretches from January to June, so keeping track of the delegate math can get complicated if there is a close race. That is not the case this year. Trump has won every state but Vermont so far and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his top rival, has suspended her campaign. Biden has won every state primary, but he did lose the Democratic caucus in American Samoa. His only remaining Democratic challenger, the author Marianne Williamson, took the unusual step of unsuspending her campaign earlier this year. She has not yet won any delegates.What is a delegate?Performing well in primaries and caucuses equals delegates, and the larger goal is amassing the magic number of delegates to secure a nomination before delegate voting atthe party convention.How many delegates are there?Winning the GOP nomination requires at least 1,215 out of 2,429 delegates awarded as part of the primary process.In years without an incumbent, like Republicans are experiencing in 2024, the winner frequently does not hit the magic number until May or even June. In 2016, in his first of three White House runs,on May 26. Trump’s ability to hit the magic number in March is historic andWhen will delegates be secured in 2024?How does a candidate win delegates?During most of the early primaries and caucuses, states award delegates proportionally. That means that each candidate gets a number of delegates roughly equivalent to the percentage of the vote he or she has won. Delegates can be awarded based on results either statewide or in individual congressional districts.For example, in 2016, Sen. Ted Cruz won the Iowa caucuses, but with less than 30% of the vote, he only got eight delegates. Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio both got seven delegates in Iowa that year.Sometimes, there’s a certain amount of support a candidate must register to qualify for delegates, and many of these states have special rules that allow a candidate who wins the lion’s share of the vote (often 50%) to take all of the state’s delegates.Things change after March 15. That’s when states have the option to award all of their delegates to whoever gets the most votes in the state’s contest.The introduction of winner-take-all rules makes it harder for any remaining candidates to accumulate delegates against the race leader.Is New Hampshire more important than other primaries and caucuses?While you’re bound to hear a lot aboutand New Hampshire, contests that can be critical for giving candidates early momentum, those two states represent a small number of delegates.It’s not until Super Tuesday on March 5, seven weeks after the first Americans pick a candidate in Iowa, that a consequentially large number of Republican delegates is at stake. It was on Super Tuesday that Trump effectively won the nomination, forcing Haley from the race, although the process must continue to play out.Below, explore how many delegates are at stake in every contest.What are the different types of delegates?In addition to delegates who are bound to a candidate based on the results of the nominating contests, there is also a relatively small number of unbound delegates (142 total) from Pennsylvania, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and Guam. These delegates are not technically required to support the candidate who won their state at the outset of the convention and are free to support the candidate of their choice.What happens if no candidate reaches the magic number?The delegate math gets even more complicated if no candidate reaches the magic number during the nominating contests, although this hasn’t happened for decades. If there is no clear winner during the primaries, delegates could engage in rounds of voting at the convention to select the party’s presidential candidate.What happens to delegates when their candidate drops out?Short answer: it depends. Different states have different rules. In some states, if a candidate drops out and releases their delegates, they become free to support the candidate of their choice. In the case of the delegates Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy won in Iowa, under state party rules, those delegates will remain bound to their candidates until the convention, but if just one name is placed into nomination during the formal roll-call vote, the entire Iowa delegation votes for that candidate.What about the Democrats this primary season?While President Joe Biden has not faced much opposition in the Democratic primary, he still needs to win at least 1,968 of 3,934 pledged delegates awarded as part of the primary process. If he had been unable toget a majority, he’d need help from about 740 automatic delegates, made up of party leaders, elected officials and other Democratic bigwigs.To see live election results, visit our.© 2024 Cable News Network.

       "  ['Less than four years after Oregon voters decided to decriminalize small amounts of hard drugs in the state, legislators have had enough.A surge in fentanyl overdoses in the state drove state lawmakers to, which was meant to signal an end to the decadeslong war on drugs.Oregon has suffered a spike in overdoses, but there is disagreement among researchers over whether the decriminalization effort or theis to blame. The decriminalization effort came quickly, and its goal of pouring money into treatment instead of prosecuting drug crimes barely had time to take hold.Certainly, the image of people openly using drugs in Oregon’s cities has been jarring, as CNN’s Josh Campbell and Michelle Krupa found. They traveled to Portland after the city’s Democratic mayor and the state’s Democratic governor declared a state of emergency over the fentanyl crisis.“Essentially what has happened is drugs in Oregon are the same as a traffic ticket,” Portland police Officer David Baer told them. And the fine can be waived if a user calls a hotline and agrees to a medical screening.Campbell and Krupa talked to people on every side of the complicated issue..If the newly passed bill is signed into law by Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek – she has not yet said what she will do – possession of small amounts of hard drugs would be punishable by up to six months in jail, although there would be alternatives to the penalty in the form of required treatment.Enacting the law to undo the voter initiative will, according to, apparently end efforts by at least one group to go further than the re-criminalization bill and couldhave put the issue back to voters this year.One way to view Oregon’s retreat from its idealistic effort to decriminalize drug use is that it’s in line with other liberal areas.Washington state, for example, struggled toafter a state court declared its felony drug possession law unconstitutional in 2021. San Francisco voters last year, an advocate for criminal justice reform. The recall was a referendum on rising crime rates and open drug use in the city.Similarly, Democratic mayors in cities like New York and Chicago are now rethinking well-meaning sanctuary policies after thousands of asylum-seeking migrants were bused to them, without coordination, by Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in an ongoing bit of protest.But it is also worth looking at the Oregon drug use experiment from the perspective of direct democracy.Elected representatives, for a variety of reasons, frequently work to undermine ballot initiatives. Perhaps in Oregon, if voters were given the option of rolling back the decriminalization experiment they OK’d in 2020, they would have done so.That’s what Missouri voters did with regard to the drawing of congressional maps. In 2018, voters there passed a slate of good-government proposals to take some of the politics out of the redistricting process. Two years later, before those proposals fully took effect, Missouri voters undid them with a different initiative that reinserted politics in the process.In Florida, voters voted overwhelmingly in 2018to re-enfranchise felons who served out their sentences.undermined that sentiment by placing conditions on restoring the right to vote.In Ohio, Republican lawmakers feared an initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution last November, so they called a special election for August on a separate amendment meant to make it more difficult to amend the state’s constitution. The idea was that a low-turnout, special election would help the anti-abortion rights effort.and then went on toin November.There are efforts underway in states across the country to make it more difficult to get initiatives placed on ballots, according to theat the New York University School of Law. The centernotes that some strategies include raising the number of signatures required to get an initiative in front of voters or requiring signatures to come from all over the state, although these frequently run into problems in court.About half the states allow for statewide initiatives, but restrictions put in place by legislators mean the process is really only usable in 17, according to Dane Waters, who has worked on direct democracy efforts both in the US and abroad and is founder of the Initiative & Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California.“People like representative government most of the time,” Waters told me. “Like 99.9% of the time.”But there are issues, frequently the ones where legislatures refuse to act or are slow, where voters get out of whack with their representatives.“Lawmakers try to avoid these issues that may be politically unpalatable for them,” he said.In red states, that might mean voters end up trying to raise the minimum wage or expand access to Medicaid through the initiative process. In blue states, it could be that voters take on tax issues.Waters worked on initiatives regarding term limits in the 1990s, and those efforts, which sought to limit how long legislators could serve, led lawmakers to try to limit the initiative process.Voters may ultimately want to change their minds. In California, Proposition 8 was a referendum that passed in 2008 that banned same-sex marriage with an amendment to the state constitution. That language was superseded when the USSupreme Court ultimately created a nationwide right to marriage. Still, California voters will get the opportunity tofrom their constitution with a referendum on Election Day in November.© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

       "  ['A critical US partner in northwest Africa is turning toward Russia amid warnings from the top US commander in the continent that the Russians are trying to “take over” the entire Sahel region of Africa.Niger, which has served as a crucial foothold for US counterterrorism operations in the region for nearly a decade,that it was ending the accord that has allowed US military personnel and civilian staff to operate in the country since 2014.The announcement came days after a tense meeting between Niger’s military junta, which seized power in a, and US diplomatic and military officials including Gen. Michael Langley, commander of US Africa Command, and  Celeste Wallander, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, defense officials told CNN. In that meeting, the US delegation expressed concern about the escalating Russian military presence in Niger, officials said, and particularly about the future of Air Base 101 in Niger’s capital and whether it will be ceded to the Russians, officials said.The discussion angered the junta leaders, who felt like they were being lectured to, despite the US cutting off much of its military and foreign assistance to Niger late last year following the coup.“When it comes to choosing diplomatic, strategic and military partners, the government of Niger regrets the willingness of the American delegation to deny the sovereign people of Niger the right to choose its partners and the types of partnerships likely to help it to truly fight terrorism, even though the United States of America has unilaterally decided to suspend all cooperation between our two countries,” Col. Maj. Amadou Abdramane, a Nigerien military spokesman, said in a statement Saturday, adding that the US delegation had a “condescending attitude” toward the Nigeriens.Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed on Monday that the US delegation “expressed concern over Niger’s potential relationships with Russia” as well as with Iran.“We raised our concerns in a direct and frank manner,” she said.The intensifying military cooperation between Russia and Niger is central to the dispute between the US and the Nigerien junta, officials said. Russia and Niger agreed to strengthen their military ties in January, Russia’s Defense Ministry said at the time.Still, while US counterterrorism operations and training with the Nigerien military largely paused after the coup, the junta did not ask the US to leave, even after kicking out French troops and cutting remaining ties with the EU in late 2023.Several of the junta leaders have worked with and been trained by the US as part of the US’ security cooperation with the country over the years. And the Pentagon has been eager to keep a force presence in the country, with many administration officialsto tackle terrorism in the region and arguing that it’s feasible even amid the political turmoil there.Now, however, there is concern among US military officials that with Russia’s increasing presence in Niger, the Kremlin has established another foothold in the Sahel region and the West is losing its influence, a military source with knowledge of the situation said.Langley, the AFRICOM commander,that the US has been “drowned out” by Russian disinformation across Africa in previous years, leading to Russia’s success in stoking “a lot of the instability across the Sahel.”He added that both Russia and China “want that ground. They want power projection capabilities. … But I think at [an] accelerated pace, the Russian Federation is really trying to take over Central Africa as well as the Sahel.”State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Saturday that the US remains in touch with the junta, which calls itself the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland, or CNSP.“We are aware of the statement from the CNSP in Niger, which follows frank discussions at senior levels in Niamey this week about our concerns with the CNSP’s trajectory,” Miller said in a statement. “We are in touch with the CNSP and will provide further updates as warranted.”It is not yet clear whether the military junta in Niger will actually force the US military to leave the country, where US forces have conducted anti-terror operations and trained the Nigerien military since 2014.If the US were forced to withdraw, counterterrorism efforts across the region could take a hit, officials said. US drone flights out of an air base in Agadez,Niger, have given the US the ability to monitor threats in the Sahel region from a relatively close and stable position, especially as violent terror organizations have carried out a growing number of attacks in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso.Officials are also concerned that withdrawing the approximately 650 US troops stationed in Niger could leave a vacuum that Islamist militants and Russian mercenaries, including what’s left of, would try to exploit.Russia has kept its sights on Niger as the US-Nigerien relationship has deteriorated. In December, the Kremlin reopened its embassy in neighboring Burkina Faso, positioning itself closer to the capital of Niger, and it has increased its effort to court Niger’s military junta, a senior intelligence official told CNN.Part of the appeal for Niger is that Russia can offer to sell its own weapons and equipment without the same conditions to respect human rights and abide by international law that the US calls for, the official said. And, for a country looking for an immediate supply of military hardware, Russia is able to sell its weapons much faster than the United States. In return, Russia is profiting off the region’s natural resources, another official said, including the gold mines in Niger.Abdramane, the Nigerien military spokesman, said Saturday that Russia “is a partner with which Niger deals on a state-to-state basis, in accordance with military cooperation agreements signed with the previous government, to acquire military equipment necessary to its fight against the terrorists who have claimed thousands of innocent Nigerian victims under the indifferent eye of much of the international community.”The US-Nigerien relationship has gone downhill quickly. Late last year, the US believed the junta government was in a “better place,” according to the senior intelligence official, and was refocusing on countering the rise of violent extremist organizations in Western Africa. The groups include ISIS-Sahel and Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam Wal-Musliminim, more commonly known as JNIM, a radical Islamist organization operating in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.A reduction in US surveillance missions in the region following the coup in Niger gave ISIS-Sahel and JNIM an opportunity to expand, the official said. But even with cooperation between the US and Niger reduced, the US military’s goal remained the same: to provide support to counter the spread of extremist organizations. Several European countries shared this goal, offering a measure of support to the junta, the official noted.But with Russia exerting more pressure and the US limited in what it can provide to Niger by law because of the coup designation, the Nigerien government has been cracking down even harder on the remaining Western military presence in the country, the sources said. US operations in the country require stricter Nigerien oversight and approval, even as the Russian presence in the country has grown increasingly visible.“Northwest Africa is getting carved up in real time by half a dozen or more countries,” one of the officials said, “and the United States is losing its foothold.”© 2024 Cable News Network.

The US transferred over one million rounds of seized Iranian ammunition to the Ukrainian armed forces in October,Over the past year, the US Navy has seized thousands of Iranian assault rifles and more than one million rounds of ammunition from vessels used by Iran to ship weapons to the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The seizures, frequently carried out with regional partner forces, target small stateless vessels on routes historically used to smuggle weapons to the Houthis.For the last year, the Biden administration has been working to legally send the seized weapons, which are stored in CENTCOM facilities across the Middle East, to the Ukrainians.© 2024 Cable News Network.

       "  ['Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump already effectively sealed their party’s nominations on Super Tuesday. They’re both likely to reach the magic number of delegates in contests on March 12. But Americans across the country will continue to take part in the primary process until the final contests in June.Winning individual primaries and caucuses is just one step in the long path to winning a party’s presidential nomination. That process will continue to play out even though the outcome is assured. This story looks specifically at the Republican process, where there was more competition early in the race.How does the Republican Party pick a presidential candidate, in a nutshell?Both parties hold conventions in the summer where delegates technically select the nominee. The process and rules are different for each party, but the primaries are about winning enough delegates to secure the nomination.There are different kinds of nominating contests and different kinds of delegates in athat stretches from January to June, so keeping track of the delegate math can get complicated if there is a close race. That is not the case this year. Trump has won every state but Vermont so far and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his top rival, has suspended her campaign. Biden has won every state primary, but he did lose the Democratic caucus in American Samoa. His only remaining Democratic challenger, the author Marianne Williamson, took the unusual step of unsuspending her campaign earlier this year. She has not yet won any delegates.What is a delegate?Performing well in primaries and caucuses equals delegates, and the larger goal is amassing the magic number of delegates to secure a nomination before delegate voting atthe party convention.How many delegates are there?Winning the GOP nomination requires at least 1,215 out of 2,429 delegates awarded as part of the primary process.In years without an incumbent, like Republicans are experiencing in 2024, the winner frequently does not hit the magic number until May or even June. In 2016, in his first of three White House runs,on May 26. Trump’s ability to hit the magic number in March is historic andWhen will delegates be secured in 2024?How does a candidate win delegates?During most of the early primaries and caucuses, states award delegates proportionally. That means that each candidate gets a number of delegates roughly equivalent to the percentage of the vote he or she has won. Delegates can be awarded based on results either statewide or in individual congressional districts.For example, in 2016, Sen. Ted Cruz won the Iowa caucuses, but with less than 30% of the vote, he only got eight delegates. Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio both got seven delegates in Iowa that year.Sometimes, there’s a certain amount of support a candidate must register to qualify for delegates, and many of these states have special rules that allow a candidate who wins the lion’s share of the vote (often 50%) to take all of the state’s delegates.Things change after March 15. That’s when states have the option to award all of their delegates to whoever gets the most votes in the state’s contest.The introduction of winner-take-all rules makes it harder for any remaining candidates to accumulate delegates against the race leader.Is New Hampshire more important than other primaries and caucuses?While you’re bound to hear a lot aboutand New Hampshire, contests that can be critical for giving candidates early momentum, those two states represent a small number of delegates.It’s not until Super Tuesday on March 5, seven weeks after the first Americans pick a candidate in Iowa, that a consequentially large number of Republican delegates is at stake. It was on Super Tuesday that Trump effectively won the nomination, forcing Haley from the race, although the process must continue to play out.Below, explore how many delegates are at stake in every contest.What are the different types of delegates?In addition to delegates who are bound to a candidate based on the results of the nominating contests, there is also a relatively small number of unbound delegates (142 total) from Pennsylvania, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and Guam. These delegates are not technically required to support the candidate who won their state at the outset of the convention and are free to support the candidate of their choice.What happens if no candidate reaches the magic number?The delegate math gets even more complicated if no candidate reaches the magic number during the nominating contests, although this hasn’t happened for decades. If there is no clear winner during the primaries, delegates could engage in rounds of voting at the convention to select the party’s presidential candidate.What happens to delegates when their candidate drops out?Short answer: it depends. Different states have different rules. In some states, if a candidate drops out and releases their delegates, they become free to support the candidate of their choice. In the case of the delegates Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy won in Iowa, under state party rules, those delegates will remain bound to their candidates until the convention, but if just one name is placed into nomination during the formal roll-call vote, the entire Iowa delegation votes for that candidate.What about the Democrats this primary season?While President Joe Biden has not faced much opposition in the Democratic primary, he still needs to win at least 1,968 of 3,934 pledged delegates awarded as part of the primary process. If he had been unable toget a majority, he’d need help from about 740 automatic delegates, made up of party leaders, elected officials and other Democratic bigwigs.To see live election results, visit our.© 2024 Cable News Network.

       "  ['Senior US officials, Americans who had returned from detention abroad and loved ones of those who have yet to come home gathered in front of the US State Department as a new flag was raised ahead of the nation’s first-ever Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day.“This is a solemn day,” Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Friday as he stood before the flag, bearing the words “bring them home” and dozens of tally marks.“Today’s ceremony is a solemn recognition of those who have returned home, those who regrettably never will, and those still being held captive abroad,” he said, adding that it was “an opportunity to recommit ourselves – to truly recommit ourselves – to stand united against the scourge of hostage diplomacy, and to reaffirm the principles of peace, justice and human dignity for all.”“The State Department will solemnly raise the flag each year and whenever a hostage or wrongfully detained returns from abroad or dies in captivity,” Campbell said.Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day will be annually recognized on March 9 – the date on which former FBI agent Robert Levinson was abducted in Iran 17 years ago. Levinson isHis family members are strong advocates for the hostage and detainee community, and legislation on wrongful detention has been named in his honor.Speaking outside the State Department Friday, Campbell vowed to the loved ones of those still held abroad: “The United States government is with you and we will work tirelessly until you are reunited with your loved ones.”However, for some, the message rang hollow. As the years have gone by with few apparent updates and little to no public acknowledgment by the US government, these families say they fear that their loved ones cases’ are not being made a priority.“We do feel invisible,” said Maryam Kamalmaz, whosewas detained in Syria in February 2017. He hasn’t been heard from since.Kamalmaz is among the family members who have called on President Joe Biden to meet with them – a request that has not yet been granted.After the flag raising Friday, they gathered in Lafayette Park in front of the White House to once again plead their case.“We are sick and tired. Sick and tired of standing in front of the White House, having to travel across the country to DC, to the doorstep of President Biden, begging with him to just meet with us. Even for only five minutes,” said Harrison Li, whose father“We were here in December, sitting in this park, begging for President Biden to see us for a few minutes to talk about our loved ones,” said Aida Dagher, the sister-in-law of Zack Shahin, imprisoned in the United Arab Emirates. “The next morning, he met with the families of Gaza hostages. We’re very happy for them. We’re not jealous. But treat us all equally.”US officials have repeatedly said that a meeting with the president is not necessary to ensure that their loved ones’ cases are being worked on and it does not expedite someone’s release.“We know the president has met with some families and not all of them have come home,” Li said.“We know it’s not easy. There’s no magic button,” he said. “But at the same time, if the president doesn’t even hear from us, doesn’t know the names of our loved ones or isn’t reminded of it, he’s not going to be able to do anything.”US officials say that bringing home Americans wrongfully held abroad is a top priority. In his State of the Union address Thursday, Biden said the US will “work around the clock to bring home Evan (Gershkovich) and Paul (Whelan) — Americans being unjustly detained by the Russians — and others around the world.”Whelanthat he would like to speak with Biden, to “remind the President and the National Security Council that I’m still here, being held hostage by the Russian government, and the Biden administration has got to take decisive action to secure my release.”“If they don’t do anything, I’m stuck here. And if I’m stuck here, I die here,” he said.© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.'],\n",

       "  ['It’s an important new phase of, when the early contests are over and voters from multiple states cast ballots in primaries timed to occur on the same date.It’s called “Super Tuesday,” and it is important even though neither Democratic President Joe Biden nor former President Donald Trump has had to sweat the competition this year. Primaries on Tuesday may offer the final opportunity for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s quixotic and lackluster effort to challenge Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.Instead of a single primary or caucus, Super Tuesday lumps together 15 contests for Republicans and 16 contests for Democrats spread across the country.More than a third ofare at stake along with an equally large portion of Democratic delegates. Biden is undefeated in primary contests this year, and Trump has lost only one.A large sample of the country will have contests on Super Tuesday – red states and blue states from the North, South, East and West.The primaries at stake include the first three states in the alphabet, as any schoolkid should be able to tell you: Alabama, Alaska (for Republicans) and Arkansas. In addition, there are California and Colorado; Maine, Massachusetts and Minnesota; North Carolina; Oklahoma; Tennessee and Texas; Utah; and Vermont and Virginia.Tuesday also marks the end of Democrats’ mail-in presidential preference process in Iowa, and a Democratic caucus in American Samoa.In 2016, Super Tuesday was the moment when Trump really seized control of the Republican primary. Trump won seven of the 11 contests that day, although he lost the largest prize, Texas. There was still a spirited race for delegates in 2016, as opposed to this year, when Trump has won nearly every contest before Super Tuesday and has a growing delegate lead over Haley.In 2020, Biden won 10 of 14 contests on Super Tuesday. He has not faced any serious competition from Democrats this year and is expected, as is traditional for incumbents, to win every contest Tuesday.For Republicans, the question is whether Haley can gain any traction. She has won only one contest – the primary in Washington, DC,. She is falling far behind in terms of delegates, but Haley insists that Republicans deserve a second option.Barring some unforeseen eruption of support for Haley, will a setback on Super Tuesday push her out of the race?For Democrats, Biden is coming off a. He won the Democratic primary there easily, but more than 100,000 Democratic primary voters chose “uncommitted” rather than Biden. “Uncommitted” won two of Michigan’s delegates, the only delegates Biden has lost so far.As the Palestinian, the Democratic primary voters in a state with a strong Arab American and Muslim population were protesting the president’s Israel policy and want him to push much more forcefully for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Are there signs of more protest on Super Tuesday?Meanwhile, neither of the Democrats challenging Biden has gained much traction. Rep. Dean Phillips has failed to get out of the single digits in states where Biden has campaigned. One former, fringe rival, Marianne Williamson, has actually taken the unusual step of unsuspending her campaign.Not technically on Super Tuesday. Neither candidate can win a majority of the delegates until later in March, with both candidates likely to pass the “magic number” on March 12 or March 19.Trump will need to win 1,215 of 2,429 delegates, while Biden needs 1,968 out of 3,934 delegates.Regardless,until early June. Conventions don’t take place until July for Republicans and August for Democrats.The modern primary system has only grown up in recent decades. Super Tuesday has grown with it. The term was first. Democrats in Southern states, wanting a moderate candidate, timed their primaries for. It has not always achieved that goal.Then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, a liberal, largely put the 1988 Democratic primary away with victories on Super Tuesday. In 1992, however, then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton completed his comeback by sweeping Southern states on Super Tuesday that year.In 2008, 21 states held contests on a Super Tuesday in early February, an example of front-loading the primaries. But then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton split the delegates among Democrats. Sen. John McCain decisively pushed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney from the GOP race.© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.'],\n",
       "  ['In the weird and wonky world of Washington, funding deadlines written into law are mere suggestions and the threat of a partial government shutdown is always on the horizon.The 2024 fiscal year started on October 1, but lawmakers have yet to officially pass the 12 funding bills that are supposed to form the backbone of discretionary government spending – things like defense spending, etc.Unable to finalize an agreement on those larger bills, lawmakers have passed a series of temporary bills, or “continuing resolutions” – or “CRs,” as they’re referred to in the lexicon of the federal government, which is arguably its own dialect of the English language.Journalists frequently try to translate “continuing resolution” or “CR” into plain English by referring to it as a “stopgap” spending bill or a “short-term” spending bill.The House and Senate passed another short-term extension for part of the government this week, which President Joe Biden, giving  Congress some more time to negotiate spending five months after the fact.The latest in a series of deadlines caused by these temporary spending bills is next Friday, March 8, for part of the government and March 22 for the rest of it.Pretty much every year. Far from a unique occurrence, continuing resolutions are an annual affair.October 1 has been the official kickoff date for the federal fiscal year since 1977. Lawmakers have passed at least one continuing resolution in all but three of the years in the nearly half-centurysince. The 1997 fiscal year was the most recent one in which no CRs were enacted, according to the.Lawmakers don’t even seem to be trying very hard to pass the bills on time at this point. Federal discretionary spending is supposed to be broken down into 12 appropriations bills. In most years for the past two decades, lawmakers haven’t passed a single one by October 1. They haven’t passed half of the appropriations bills on time in any year since 1997.Instead, they will wrap the spending bills into larger packages – frequently called an “omnibus” that is passed in December or later. In 1997, for instance, there was no CR, but the spending bills were all passed together as an omnibus. In 2017, the final bills were not enacted until after May 1, according to the.On the one hand, these bills are superior to the alternative, which would be a partial government shutdown. Much has been written about how inefficient, unnecessary and disruptive partial shutdowns can be.CRs are a different kind of inefficient and disruptive occurrence. While government operations and services continue, CRs do have an effect. GAO has written in-depth reports that outline how CRs “slow hiring, create funding uncertainty, and cause administrative burdens.”In years like this one, when a patchwork of CRs extends for a large portion of the year, those effects are amplified.The whole point of Congress approving funding is to guide the federal government. They add funding for certain programs and subtract it for others. With CRs, those tweaks usually aren’t happening.“The thousands of hours agencies spend on budget planning are wasted when Congress simply bypasses the regular appropriations process and uses a CR,”, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, in 2018.I asked CNN’s Tami Luhby how the herky-jerky funding process – and simply relying on last year’s funding levels – can affect the way the government provides services to people. She offered up the following examples and argued that the effects are particularly focused on those who depend on government aid for food assistance and help paying for utilities.Private sector companies could not operate in this way, and neither should the federal government, according to an argument from the, which advocates for good governance and has argued for moving the government funding process to a two-year instead of every year schedule.It’s hard to foster innovation or security if workers are constantly stopping and starting. Other ideas include automatic CRs – almost like an automatic overdraft protection so Congress can debate the larger spending bills instead of wasting time on the temporary ones.Republicans who control the House and Democrats who control the Senate were on the cusp of a funding deal back in January that would have imposed some funding limits for 2024 and 2025 as spending-conscious Republicans demanded.To his credit, instead of embracing a shutdown mentality, House Speaker Mike Johnson has instead kept the government open and kicked the can down the roadby utilizing Democratic votes to pass CRs as they iron out the details for the larger bill.CNN’sthe six funding bills that lawmakers have reached an agreement on and plan to pass before March 8 include departments of Agriculture-FDA; Commerce, Justice and Science; Energy and Water Development; Interior; Military Construction-Veterans Affairs; and Transportation-Housing and Urban Development.The remaining six appropriations bills that lawmakers plan to vote on prior to March 22 are Defense; Financial Services and General Government; Homeland Security; Labor-Health and Human Services; the Legislative Branch; and State and Foreign Operations.There is optimism they will figure it out – just in time to get started on next year’s funding. Don’t hold your breath for them to get the 2025 spending bills done on time.© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

       "  ['North Korea watchers in Washington have fixated recently on Pyongyang’sdedicated to reunifying the Korean Peninsula — a move that some outside analysts view as a precursor to war with South Korea amid typically bellicose rhetoric from leader Kim Jong Un.But US officials and North Korea analysts who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity say the uproar over the reunification arch obscures a far greater strategic threat: North Korea’s burgeoning partnership with Russia.Intelligence officials in Washington are increasingly concerned about the growing ties between North Korea and Russia, and the long-term implications of what appears to be a new level of strategic partnership between the two nations, according to multiple officials familiar with the latest intelligence.Russia has repeatedly fired North Korean-supplied short-range ballistic missiles at Ukrainian targets in recent weeks. In January, high-ranking North Korean and Russian diplomats met in Moscow in advance of what North Korean state media says is a forthcoming visit to Pyongyang by Russian President Vladimir Putin himself — his first in more than 20 years.The Biden administration is concerned enough that national security adviser Jake Sullivan raised the issue with the Chinese foreign minister during a January meeting, a senior White House official told reporters late last month.If North Korea is able to use a tighter relationship with Russia to loosen China’s influence, officials fear, that could remove what some believe has been an important handbrake on Pyongyang’s nuclear testing program.“I think [Kim] is constantly looking for some kind of an edge,” a senior defense official said.A senior administration official told reporters in late January, “We are deeply concerned about the recent testing of weapons. We are deeply concerned about the growing relationship between Russia and the DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] and what that might mean for Mr. Kim’s intentions.”Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said Pyongyang has long sought to balance Chinese influence over its affairs by pursuing dialogue with other nations — including the Soviet Union and, later, the United States. North Korea’s newly forged transactional partnership with Moscow is best understood as Kim seizing an opportunity to give himself maneuvering room with China, Lewis and others said.The risks that relationship poses to US interests are numerous, according to multiple analysts both inside and outside of government.Although Lewis and others believe the US often overestimates the degree of control Beijing has over North Korea, it does have influence and seeks to ensure stability on the peninsula. But North Korea is “terrified that the Chinese are going to functionally take over the country, not with an army, but culturally and financially,” Lewis said. Russia is “a very natural alliance that allows them to reduce their dependency on China,” he said.An infusion of Russian cash — and potentially Russian technology — in exchange for North Korean missiles could also jumpstart North Korea’s defense industrial base, allowing Pyongyang to update its stockpiles of conventional munitions and giving its economy a much-needed boost. That, in turn, could accelerate its missile development program.Trade with Russia could also further weaken the sanctions regime the US has placed on North Korea, also accelerating its economy and potentially bolstering its arms development program.And perhaps most alarmingly, North Korean missiles on the Russian battlefield could act as an advertisement for further sales to other rogue regimes.“These are credible battlefield tools, and should North Korea succeed in selling these, it would enable them to build more and help in their domestic deployment — and, of course, have a snowball effect to find even more customers,” said Sydney Seiler, the national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council until 2023.Lewis, Seiler and others cautioned that none of these outcomes are foretold. As always with North Korea, deciphering how the hermit kingdom may respond is like reading chicken bones.But within government, officials are watching the dynamic closely.For weeks, aon an influential North Korea watchers website written by two former analysts circulated within the US government. It warned that Pyongyang’s decision to abandon reunification was a clear signal that North Korea had made the “strategic decision to go to war.”The problem, according to more than half a dozen US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence, was that the piece was wrong.“I do not think [Kim] has made a strategic decision to conflict,” the senior defense official said. “I have not seen anything indicative of strategic conflict.”Five US officials told CNN the US has seen no signs Kim is preparing for a potential attack on South Korea, or a broader provocation involving nuclear weapons.If anything, some analysts believe, North Korea’s public statements signal that North Korea is abandoning its reunification policy in pursuit of peace on the peninsula.Kim’s “No. 1 priority is the sustainment of his regime,” the defense official said. “That’s not a shift — that’s been a strategic priority of his entire family since the Korean War.”Lewis, Seiler and others said Kim is very consistent in publicly messaging his intentions. In speeches announcing the abandonment of reunification, Kim made clear that he was not seeking war with South Korea.“Kim went out of his way to explicitly say that one implication of rejecting reunification was that he was also rejecting reunification by force — so the clear message was that North Korea would not initiate a war with South Korea,” Lewis said, adding that it was “the weirdest reassurance in history.”That does not mean Pyongyang might not launch lower-level attacks short of all-out war, analysts said — something North Korea occasionally does for reasons that can be opaque to US intelligence.Pyongyang often uses military exercises in the region conducted by the US, South Korea and Japan beginning this time of year as an opportunity to engage in what the US terms “provocative” actions.“But it’s not war. We’re not headed to war,” Seiler said. “We are headed to what I think would be a higher-tension season, but if we stay the course, we’ll come out the other end OK.”In 2010, North Korea shelled a South Korean island, and the two sides exchanged artillery fire that killed troops on both sides. But the conflict never escalated.The senior defense official said that, for now, the US does not see any indicators that North Korea is preparing for anything like that, but noted, “I get paid to think about such possibilities.”North Korea is also unlikely to step back from its missile development program — something that defense officials watch with alarm, even as they broadly believe Pyongyang views the program as defensive rather than offensive.Officials still believe North Korea could be poised to carry out another nuclear test.And Pyongyang has made notable improvements in the solid fuels used for shorter- and longer-range missiles. Because solid fuels can be stored in the field for weeks at a time, US officials are concerned the improved technology will allow North Korea to move its missiles around and hide them from foreign surveillance more easily.“Their increasing and continual launching of missile tests — that I think is the most concerning part,” the senior defense official said. “I worry about errant missiles going off to potentially hit a populated area. Even if not deliberate, that’s an action that could be devastating.”© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.'],\n",
       "  ['It’s an important new phase of, when the early contests are over and voters from multiple states cast ballots in primaries timed to occur on the same date.It’s called “Super Tuesday,” and it is important even though neither Democratic President Joe Biden nor former President Donald Trump has had to sweat the competition this year. Primaries on Tuesday may offer the final opportunity for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s quixotic and lackluster effort to challenge Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.Instead of a single primary or caucus, Super Tuesday lumps together 15 contests for Republicans and 16 contests for Democrats spread across the country.More than a third ofare at stake along with an equally large portion of Democratic delegates. Biden is undefeated in primary contests this year, and Trump has lost only one.A large sample of the country will have contests on Super Tuesday – red states and blue states from the North, South, East and West.The primaries at stake include the first three states in the alphabet, as any schoolkid should be able to tell you: Alabama, Alaska (for Republicans) and Arkansas. In addition, there are California and Colorado; Maine, Massachusetts and Minnesota; North Carolina; Oklahoma; Tennessee and Texas; Utah; and Vermont and Virginia.Tuesday also marks the end of Democrats’ mail-in presidential preference process in Iowa, and a Democratic caucus in American Samoa.In 2016, Super Tuesday was the moment when Trump really seized control of the Republican primary. Trump won seven of the 11 contests that day, although he lost the largest prize, Texas. There was still a spirited race for delegates in 2016, as opposed to this year, when Trump has won nearly every contest before Super Tuesday and has a growing delegate lead over Haley.In 2020, Biden won 10 of 14 contests on Super Tuesday. He has not faced any serious competition from Democrats this year and is expected, as is traditional for incumbents, to win every contest Tuesday.For Republicans, the question is whether Haley can gain any traction. She has won only one contest – the primary in Washington, DC,. She is falling far behind in terms of delegates, but Haley insists that Republicans deserve a second option.Barring some unforeseen eruption of support for Haley, will a setback on Super Tuesday push her out of the race?For Democrats, Biden is coming off a. He won the Democratic primary there easily, but more than 100,000 Democratic primary voters chose “uncommitted” rather than Biden. “Uncommitted” won two of Michigan’s delegates, the only delegates Biden has lost so far.As the Palestinian, the Democratic primary voters in a state with a strong Arab American and Muslim population were protesting the president’s Israel policy and want him to push much more forcefully for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Are there signs of more protest on Super Tuesday?Meanwhile, neither of the Democrats challenging Biden has gained much traction. Rep. Dean Phillips has failed to get out of the single digits in states where Biden has campaigned. One former, fringe rival, Marianne Williamson, has actually taken the unusual step of unsuspending her campaign.Not technically on Super Tuesday. Neither candidate can win a majority of the delegates until later in March, with both candidates likely to pass the “magic number” on March 12 or March 19.Trump will need to win 1,215 of 2,429 delegates, while Biden needs 1,968 out of 3,934 delegates.Regardless,until early June. Conventions don’t take place until July for Republicans and August for Democrats.The modern primary system has only grown up in recent decades. Super Tuesday has grown with it. The term was first. Democrats in Southern states, wanting a moderate candidate, timed their primaries for. It has not always achieved that goal.Then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, a liberal, largely put the 1988 Democratic primary away with victories on Super Tuesday. In 1992, however, then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton completed his comeback by sweeping Southern states on Super Tuesday that year.In 2008, 21 states held contests on a Super Tuesday in early February, an example of front-loading the primaries. But then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton split the delegates among Democrats. Sen. John McCain decisively pushed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney from the GOP race.© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.'],\n",
       "  ['The US transferred thousands of machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition seized from Iran tolast week, US Central Command announced on Tuesday.Ukraine has been suffering from shortages of weapons and munitions on the battlefield in its war against Russia, with the US unable to send more equipment from its own stockpiles.CENTCOM said the materiel transferred to Ukraine is enough to equip one Ukrainian brigade — around 4,000 personnel — with small-arms rifles. “These weapons will help Ukraine defend against Russia’s invasion,” CENTCOM said in a statement.The munitions were originally seized by the US military and its partners “from four separate transiting stateless vessels between 22 May 2021 to 15 Feb 2023,” but the US government did not obtain ownership of the equipment via the Justice Department’s civil forfeiture process until December of last year, CENTCOM said.It is not the first time the US has transferred seized Iranian military equipment to the Ukrainians. The US transferred over one million rounds of seized Iranian ammunition to the Ukrainian armed forces in October,Over the past year, the US Navy has seized thousands of Iranian assault rifles and more than one million rounds of ammunition from vessels used by Iran to ship weapons to the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The seizures, frequently carried out with regional partner forces, target small stateless vessels on routes historically used to smuggle weapons to the Houthis.For the last year, the Biden administration has been working to legally send the seized weapons, which are stored in CENTCOM facilities across the Middle East, to the Ukrainians.© 2024 Cable News Network.

       "  ['Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump already effectively sealed their party’s nominations on Super Tuesday. They’re both likely to reach the magic number of delegates in contests on March 12. But Americans across the country will continue to take part in the primary process until the final contests in June.Winning individual primaries and caucuses is just one step in the long path to winning a party’s presidential nomination. That process will continue to play out even though the outcome is assured. This story looks specifically at the Republican process, where there was more competition early in the race.How does the Republican Party pick a presidential candidate, in a nutshell?Both parties hold conventions in the summer where delegates technically select the nominee. The process and rules are different for each party, but the primaries are about winning enough delegates to secure the nomination.There are different kinds of nominating contests and different kinds of delegates in athat stretches from January to June, so keeping track of the delegate math can get complicated if there is a close race. That is not the case this year. Trump has won every state but Vermont so far and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his top rival, has suspended her campaign. Biden has won every state primary, but he did lose the Democratic caucus in American Samoa. His only remaining Democratic challenger, the author Marianne Williamson, took the unusual step of unsuspending her campaign earlier this year. She has not yet won any delegates.What is a delegate?Performing well in primaries and caucuses equals delegates, and the larger goal is amassing the magic number of delegates to secure a nomination before delegate voting atthe party convention.How many delegates are there?Winning the GOP nomination requires at least 1,215 out of 2,429 delegates awarded as part of the primary process.In years without an incumbent, like Republicans are experiencing in 2024, the winner frequently does not hit the magic number until May or even June. In 2016, in his first of three White House runs,on May 26. Trump’s ability to hit the magic number in March is historic andWhen will delegates be secured in 2024?How does a candidate win delegates?During most of the early primaries and caucuses, states award delegates proportionally. That means that each candidate gets a number of delegates roughly equivalent to the percentage of the vote he or she has won. Delegates can be awarded based on results either statewide or in individual congressional districts.For example, in 2016, Sen. Ted Cruz won the Iowa caucuses, but with less than 30% of the vote, he only got eight delegates. Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio both got seven delegates in Iowa that year.Sometimes, there’s a certain amount of support a candidate must register to qualify for delegates, and many of these states have special rules that allow a candidate who wins the lion’s share of the vote (often 50%) to take all of the state’s delegates.Things change after March 15. That’s when states have the option to award all of their delegates to whoever gets the most votes in the state’s contest.The introduction of winner-take-all rules makes it harder for any remaining candidates to accumulate delegates against the race leader.Is New Hampshire more important than other primaries and caucuses?While you’re bound to hear a lot aboutand New Hampshire, contests that can be critical for giving candidates early momentum, those two states represent a small number of delegates.It’s not until Super Tuesday on March 5, seven weeks after the first Americans pick a candidate in Iowa, that a consequentially large number of Republican delegates is at stake. It was on Super Tuesday that Trump effectively won the nomination, forcing Haley from the race, although the process must continue to play out.Below, explore how many delegates are at stake in every contest.What are the different types of delegates?In addition to delegates who are bound to a candidate based on the results of the nominating contests, there is also a relatively small number of unbound delegates (142 total) from Pennsylvania, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and Guam. These delegates are not technically required to support the candidate who won their state at the outset of the convention and are free to support the candidate of their choice.What happens if no candidate reaches the magic number?The delegate math gets even more complicated if no candidate reaches the magic number during the nominating contests, although this hasn’t happened for decades. If there is no clear winner during the primaries, delegates could engage in rounds of voting at the convention to select the party’s presidential candidate.What happens to delegates when their candidate drops out?Short answer: it depends. Different states have different rules. In some states, if a candidate drops out and releases their delegates, they become free to support the candidate of their choice. In the case of the delegates Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy won in Iowa, under state party rules, those delegates will remain bound to their candidates until the convention, but if just one name is placed into nomination during the formal roll-call vote, the entire Iowa delegation votes for that candidate.What about the Democrats this primary season?While President Joe Biden has not faced much opposition in the Democratic primary, he still needs to win at least 1,968 of 3,934 pledged delegates awarded as part of the primary process. If he had been unable toget a majority, he’d need help from about 740 automatic delegates, made up of party leaders, elected officials and other Democratic bigwigs.To see live election results, visit our.© 2024 Cable News Network.

       "  ['Defense Secretaryfaced tough questions from members of Congress on Thursday in a hearing focused on his days-long delay notifying both lawmakers and President Joe Biden about his whereabouts after he was hospitalized following treatment for prostate cancer.Austin, who is still recovering from complications after the prostate cancer procedure he had in December, testified before the House Armed Services Committee as lawmakers demanded more information about his hospitalization. While members on both sides of the aisle expressed concern over his delay in notifying relevant officials of his hospitalization, the sharpest criticism largely fell along party lines.The hearing was requested by Republican chairman Mike Rogers, who said in January that Austin’s “unwillingness to provide candid and complete answers” regarding his hospitalization required a full committee hearing.“Congress must understand what happened and who made decisions to prevent the disclosure of the whereabouts of a cabinet secretary,” Rogers said into Austin.Austin emphasized repeatedly Thursday that there was no gap in authorities and “never a break in command and control” of the Pentagon.“We transferred authorities in a timely fashion,” he said. “What we didn’t do well was a notification of senior leaders.”But in opening remarks on Thursday, Rogers said it was “totally unacceptable” that the president did not know Austin’s whereabouts.“Wars were raging in Ukraine and Israel, our ships were under fire in the Red Sea, and our bases were bracing for attack in Syria and Iraq,” Roger said. “But the Commander in Chief did not know that his Secretary of Defense was out of action.”Republican Jim Banks read aloud quotes from what he called leading Russian and Chinese propaganda outlets as evidence Austin “embarrassed” the US to its adversaries.Ranking Member Adam Smith pushed back on Banks’ characterization, warning his fellow lawmakers not to “use this to the advantage of our adversaries to use it as a partisan attack.”“The United States, as all of this was going on as has been pointed out, was carrying out strikes against our adversary in order to protect our force,” Smith said. “We were doing everything we needed to do to meet the national security needs of this country, and if members of this committee incorrectly imply otherwise, they are merely giving aid and comfort to those adversaries that they claim to care about confronting.”Austin acknowledged there was a “breakdown in notifications,” but said that he “never intended to keep my hospitalization from the White House or from anybody else.”“[B]ack in December, I should have promptly informed the President, my team, Congress, and the American people about my cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment,” Austin said. “Again: We did not handle this right. And I did not handle this right … I take full responsibility.”Austin’s January 1 hospitalization prompted a flurry of questions and reviews of Pentagon processes, including one that is ongoing by the. While Austin was taken to the hospital in an ambulance on January 1 — and admitted to critical care on January 2 — it wasn’t until January 4 that his deputy Kathleen Hicks andwere told he was in the hospital. Hicks was transferred some of his authorities on January 2 but did not know why, which the Pentagon has said was not unusual.The next day, January 5, Congress and the public were informed.Austin, an intensely private person, has since said that he “never directed anyone to keep my January hospitalization from the White House” and that the news of his cancer “shook” him.“Frankly, my first instinct was to keep it private. I don’t think it’s news that I’m a pretty private guy, I never like burdening others with my problems,” Austin said during a Pentagon press conference earlier this month. “It’s just not my way. But I’ve learned from this experience, taking this kind of job means losing some of the privacy that most of us expect. The American people have a right to know if their leaders are facing health challenges that might affect their ability to perform their duties even temporarily.”But a joint statement in January from Rogers and ranking member Adam Smith said they were “concerned with how the disclosure of the Secretary’s condition was handled.”“Transparency is vitally important,” the statement on January 7 said. “Sec. Austin must provide these additional details on his health and the decision-making process that occurred in the past week as soon as possible.”The hearing on Thursday also comes just days after the Pentagon released theof the situation, which found ultimately there was no attempts to “obfuscate” Austin’s condition.The review was conducted by the director of the Office of Administration and Management, who Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said is a career official. It made multiple recommendations for how to improve communication and processes when it comes to Austin transferring authorities to his deputy in the future and notifying Congress, the White House and other relevant officials.But the review said Austin’s staff “was hesitant to pry or share any information that they did learn” out of privacy concerns. Austin has previously denied the idea that he has “created a culture of secrecy,” and Ryder defended Austin’s staff on Monday, saying it was “dedicated public servants … doing what they thought was the right thing.”In a preview of the hearing on Thursday, Rep. Rogers sharply criticized the Pentagon review in a statement on Monday, saying it “HELD NO ONE ACCOUNTABLE.”Throughout the hearing, Austin said that he did not direct anyone on his staff to hide his hospitalization from the White House, and provided insight as to how little his staff knew from the moment he got his cancer diagnosis.In a tense exchange with Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, Austin said he did not inform his staff of his diagnosis nor did he communicate that he had scheduled a surgery to treat his cancer. Austin also said he didn’t inform staff when he was getting the surgery, which occurred while he was on leave, nor when he went to the hospital on January 1.Mace then asked Austin what happens to service members when they go AWOL, or absent without leave.“Well I wouldn’t equate my going to the hospital and receiving treatment as going AWOL,” Austin said forcefully.“Being incapacitated as a secretary here, yes, is going AWOL. So you don’t equate disappearing, being incapacitated, with being AWOL?” Mace said.“I didn’t disappear,” Austin pushed back. “I was in a military medical facility in Washington, DC.”In another tense exchange with Michigan Republican Lisa McClain, Austin provided conflicting information as to whose fault it was that Biden wasn’t informed of his whereabouts for days, appearing to both say that he expected his staff to inform the appropriate agencies but that it wasn’t his staff’s fault the notification didn’t occur.“In terms of the hospitalization January 1 throughout, again, I was the patient. And so my expectation is that the organization inform the right agencies,” Austin said.“So it really wasn’t your fault, it was the staff’s fault. So you inform the staff, the staff made an error not to inform the president? I’m just trying to connect the dots,” McClain responded.“No,” Austin said, later adding that he did not have “access to any kind of communications” while he was in critical care.“You didn’t have a phone? Nothing?” McClain said.“No,” he responded.Austin pointed to the review’s recommendations Thursday, saying the “new procedures” would “prevent any lapses in notification” going forward.“I am confident that we will not experience the same issues in the future,” he said.© 2024 Cable News Network.

       "  ['A critical US partner in northwest Africa is turning toward Russia amid warnings from the top US commander in the continent that the Russians are trying to “take over” the entire Sahel region of Africa.Niger, which has served as a crucial foothold for US counterterrorism operations in the region for nearly a decade,that it was ending the accord that has allowed US military personnel and civilian staff to operate in the country since 2014.The announcement came days after a tense meeting between Niger’s military junta, which seized power in a, and US diplomatic and military officials including Gen. Michael Langley, commander of US Africa Command, and  Celeste Wallander, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, defense officials told CNN. In that meeting, the US delegation expressed concern about the escalating Russian military presence in Niger, officials said, and particularly about the future of Air Base 101 in Niger’s capital and whether it will be ceded to the Russians, officials said.The discussion angered the junta leaders, who felt like they were being lectured to, despite the US cutting off much of its military and foreign assistance to Niger late last year following the coup.“When it comes to choosing diplomatic, strategic and military partners, the government of Niger regrets the willingness of the American delegation to deny the sovereign people of Niger the right to choose its partners and the types of partnerships likely to help it to truly fight terrorism, even though the United States of America has unilaterally decided to suspend all cooperation between our two countries,” Col. Maj. Amadou Abdramane, a Nigerien military spokesman, said in a statement Saturday, adding that the US delegation had a “condescending attitude” toward the Nigeriens.Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed on Monday that the US delegation “expressed concern over Niger’s potential relationships with Russia” as well as with Iran.“We raised our concerns in a direct and frank manner,” she said.The intensifying military cooperation between Russia and Niger is central to the dispute between the US and the Nigerien junta, officials said. Russia and Niger agreed to strengthen their military ties in January, Russia’s Defense Ministry said at the time.Still, while US counterterrorism operations and training with the Nigerien military largely paused after the coup, the junta did not ask the US to leave, even after kicking out French troops and cutting remaining ties with the EU in late 2023.Several of the junta leaders have worked with and been trained by the US as part of the US’ security cooperation with the country over the years. And the Pentagon has been eager to keep a force presence in the country, with many administration officialsto tackle terrorism in the region and arguing that it’s feasible even amid the political turmoil there.Now, however, there is concern among US military officials that with Russia’s increasing presence in Niger, the Kremlin has established another foothold in the Sahel region and the West is losing its influence, a military source with knowledge of the situation said.Langley, the AFRICOM commander,that the US has been “drowned out” by Russian disinformation across Africa in previous years, leading to Russia’s success in stoking “a lot of the instability across the Sahel.”He added that both Russia and China “want that ground. They want power projection capabilities. … But I think at [an] accelerated pace, the Russian Federation is really trying to take over Central Africa as well as the Sahel.”State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Saturday that the US remains in touch with the junta, which calls itself the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland, or CNSP.“We are aware of the statement from the CNSP in Niger, which follows frank discussions at senior levels in Niamey this week about our concerns with the CNSP’s trajectory,” Miller said in a statement. “We are in touch with the CNSP and will provide further updates as warranted.”It is not yet clear whether the military junta in Niger will actually force the US military to leave the country, where US forces have conducted anti-terror operations and trained the Nigerien military since 2014.If the US were forced to withdraw, counterterrorism efforts across the region could take a hit, officials said. US drone flights out of an air base in Agadez,Niger, have given the US the ability to monitor threats in the Sahel region from a relatively close and stable position, especially as violent terror organizations have carried out a growing number of attacks in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso.Officials are also concerned that withdrawing the approximately 650 US troops stationed in Niger could leave a vacuum that Islamist militants and Russian mercenaries, including what’s left of, would try to exploit.Russia has kept its sights on Niger as the US-Nigerien relationship has deteriorated. In December, the Kremlin reopened its embassy in neighboring Burkina Faso, positioning itself closer to the capital of Niger, and it has increased its effort to court Niger’s military junta, a senior intelligence official told CNN.Part of the appeal for Niger is that Russia can offer to sell its own weapons and equipment without the same conditions to respect human rights and abide by international law that the US calls for, the official said. And, for a country looking for an immediate supply of military hardware, Russia is able to sell its weapons much faster than the United States. In return, Russia is profiting off the region’s natural resources, another official said, including the gold mines in Niger.Abdramane, the Nigerien military spokesman, said Saturday that Russia “is a partner with which Niger deals on a state-to-state basis, in accordance with military cooperation agreements signed with the previous government, to acquire military equipment necessary to its fight against the terrorists who have claimed thousands of innocent Nigerian victims under the indifferent eye of much of the international community.”The US-Nigerien relationship has gone downhill quickly. Late last year, the US believed the junta government was in a “better place,” according to the senior intelligence official, and was refocusing on countering the rise of violent extremist organizations in Western Africa. The groups include ISIS-Sahel and Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam Wal-Musliminim, more commonly known as JNIM, a radical Islamist organization operating in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.A reduction in US surveillance missions in the region following the coup in Niger gave ISIS-Sahel and JNIM an opportunity to expand, the official said. But even with cooperation between the US and Niger reduced, the US military’s goal remained the same: to provide support to counter the spread of extremist organizations. Several European countries shared this goal, offering a measure of support to the junta, the official noted.But with Russia exerting more pressure and the US limited in what it can provide to Niger by law because of the coup designation, the Nigerien government has been cracking down even harder on the remaining Western military presence in the country, the sources said. US operations in the country require stricter Nigerien oversight and approval, even as the Russian presence in the country has grown increasingly visible.“Northwest Africa is getting carved up in real time by half a dozen or more countries,” one of the officials said, “and the United States is losing its foothold.”© 2024 Cable News Network.

       "  ['Senior US officials, Americans who had returned from detention abroad and loved ones of those who have yet to come home gathered in front of the US State Department as a new flag was raised ahead of the nation’s first-ever Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day.“This is a solemn day,” Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Friday as he stood before the flag, bearing the words “bring them home” and dozens of tally marks.“Today’s ceremony is a solemn recognition of those who have returned home, those who regrettably never will, and those still being held captive abroad,” he said, adding that it was “an opportunity to recommit ourselves – to truly recommit ourselves – to stand united against the scourge of hostage diplomacy, and to reaffirm the principles of peace, justice and human dignity for all.”“The State Department will solemnly raise the flag each year and whenever a hostage or wrongfully detained returns from abroad or dies in captivity,” Campbell said.Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day will be annually recognized on March 9 – the date on which former FBI agent Robert Levinson was abducted in Iran 17 years ago. Levinson isHis family members are strong advocates for the hostage and detainee community, and legislation on wrongful detention has been named in his honor.Speaking outside the State Department Friday, Campbell vowed to the loved ones of those still held abroad: “The United States government is with you and we will work tirelessly until you are reunited with your loved ones.”However, for some, the message rang hollow. As the years have gone by with few apparent updates and little to no public acknowledgment by the US government, these families say they fear that their loved ones cases’ are not being made a priority.“We do feel invisible,” said Maryam Kamalmaz, whosewas detained in Syria in February 2017. He hasn’t been heard from since.Kamalmaz is among the family members who have called on President Joe Biden to meet with them – a request that has not yet been granted.After the flag raising Friday, they gathered in Lafayette Park in front of the White House to once again plead their case.“We are sick and tired. Sick and tired of standing in front of the White House, having to travel across the country to DC, to the doorstep of President Biden, begging with him to just meet with us. Even for only five minutes,” said Harrison Li, whose father“We were here in December, sitting in this park, begging for President Biden to see us for a few minutes to talk about our loved ones,” said Aida Dagher, the sister-in-law of Zack Shahin, imprisoned in the United Arab Emirates. “The next morning, he met with the families of Gaza hostages. We’re very happy for them. We’re not jealous. But treat us all equally.”US officials have repeatedly said that a meeting with the president is not necessary to ensure that their loved ones’ cases are being worked on and it does not expedite someone’s release.“We know the president has met with some families and not all of them have come home,” Li said.“We know it’s not easy. There’s no magic button,” he said. “But at the same time, if the president doesn’t even hear from us, doesn’t know the names of our loved ones or isn’t reminded of it, he’s not going to be able to do anything.”US officials say that bringing home Americans wrongfully held abroad is a top priority. In his State of the Union address Thursday, Biden said the US will “work around the clock to bring home Evan (Gershkovich) and Paul (Whelan) — Americans being unjustly detained by the Russians — and others around the world.”Whelanthat he would like to speak with Biden, to “remind the President and the National Security Council that I’m still here, being held hostage by the Russian government, and the Biden administration has got to take decisive action to secure my release.”“If they don’t do anything, I’m stuck here. And if I’m stuck here, I die here,” he said.© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.'],\n",
       "  ['North Korea watchers in Washington have fixated recently on Pyongyang’sdedicated to reunifying the Korean Peninsula — a move that some outside analysts view as a precursor to war with South Korea amid typically bellicose rhetoric from leader Kim Jong Un.But US officials and North Korea analysts who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity say the uproar over the reunification arch obscures a far greater strategic threat: North Korea’s burgeoning partnership with Russia.Intelligence officials in Washington are increasingly concerned about the growing ties between North Korea and Russia, and the long-term implications of what appears to be a new level of strategic partnership between the two nations, according to multiple officials familiar with the latest intelligence.Russia has repeatedly fired North Korean-supplied short-range ballistic missiles at Ukrainian targets in recent weeks. In January, high-ranking North Korean and Russian diplomats met in Moscow in advance of what North Korean state media says is a forthcoming visit to Pyongyang by Russian President Vladimir Putin himself — his first in more than 20 years.The Biden administration is concerned enough that national security adviser Jake Sullivan raised the issue with the Chinese foreign minister during a January meeting, a senior White House official told reporters late last month.If North Korea is able to use a tighter relationship with Russia to loosen China’s influence, officials fear, that could remove what some believe has been an important handbrake on Pyongyang’s nuclear testing program.“I think [Kim] is constantly looking for some kind of an edge,” a senior defense official said.A senior administration official told reporters in late January, “We are deeply concerned about the recent testing of weapons. We are deeply concerned about the growing relationship between Russia and the DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] and what that might mean for Mr. Kim’s intentions.”Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea expert and professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said Pyongyang has long sought to balance Chinese influence over its affairs by pursuing dialogue with other nations — including the Soviet Union and, later, the United States. North Korea’s newly forged transactional partnership with Moscow is best understood as Kim seizing an opportunity to give himself maneuvering room with China, Lewis and others said.The risks that relationship poses to US interests are numerous, according to multiple analysts both inside and outside of government.Although Lewis and others believe the US often overestimates the degree of control Beijing has over North Korea, it does have influence and seeks to ensure stability on the peninsula. But North Korea is “terrified that the Chinese are going to functionally take over the country, not with an army, but culturally and financially,” Lewis said. Russia is “a very natural alliance that allows them to reduce their dependency on China,” he said.An infusion of Russian cash — and potentially Russian technology — in exchange for North Korean missiles could also jumpstart North Korea’s defense industrial base, allowing Pyongyang to update its stockpiles of conventional munitions and giving its economy a much-needed boost. That, in turn, could accelerate its missile development program.Trade with Russia could also further weaken the sanctions regime the US has placed on North Korea, also accelerating its economy and potentially bolstering its arms development program.And perhaps most alarmingly, North Korean missiles on the Russian battlefield could act as an advertisement for further sales to other rogue regimes.“These are credible battlefield tools, and should North Korea succeed in selling these, it would enable them to build more and help in their domestic deployment — and, of course, have a snowball effect to find even more customers,” said Sydney Seiler, the national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council until 2023.Lewis, Seiler and others cautioned that none of these outcomes are foretold. As always with North Korea, deciphering how the hermit kingdom may respond is like reading chicken bones.But within government, officials are watching the dynamic closely.For weeks, aon an influential North Korea watchers website written by two former analysts circulated within the US government. It warned that Pyongyang’s decision to abandon reunification was a clear signal that North Korea had made the “strategic decision to go to war.”The problem, according to more than half a dozen US officials familiar with the latest US intelligence, was that the piece was wrong.“I do not think [Kim] has made a strategic decision to conflict,” the senior defense official said. “I have not seen anything indicative of strategic conflict.”Five US officials told CNN the US has seen no signs Kim is preparing for a potential attack on South Korea, or a broader provocation involving nuclear weapons.If anything, some analysts believe, North Korea’s public statements signal that North Korea is abandoning its reunification policy in pursuit of peace on the peninsula.Kim’s “No. 1 priority is the sustainment of his regime,” the defense official said. “That’s not a shift — that’s been a strategic priority of his entire family since the Korean War.”Lewis, Seiler and others said Kim is very consistent in publicly messaging his intentions. In speeches announcing the abandonment of reunification, Kim made clear that he was not seeking war with South Korea.“Kim went out of his way to explicitly say that one implication of rejecting reunification was that he was also rejecting reunification by force — so the clear message was that North Korea would not initiate a war with South Korea,” Lewis said, adding that it was “the weirdest reassurance in history.”That does not mean Pyongyang might not launch lower-level attacks short of all-out war, analysts said — something North Korea occasionally does for reasons that can be opaque to US intelligence.Pyongyang often uses military exercises in the region conducted by the US, South Korea and Japan beginning this time of year as an opportunity to engage in what the US terms “provocative” actions.“But it’s not war. We’re not headed to war,” Seiler said. “We are headed to what I think would be a higher-tension season, but if we stay the course, we’ll come out the other end OK.”In 2010, North Korea shelled a South Korean island, and the two sides exchanged artillery fire that killed troops on both sides. But the conflict never escalated.The senior defense official said that, for now, the US does not see any indicators that North Korea is preparing for anything like that, but noted, “I get paid to think about such possibilities.”North Korea is also unlikely to step back from its missile development program — something that defense officials watch with alarm, even as they broadly believe Pyongyang views the program as defensive rather than offensive.Officials still believe North Korea could be poised to carry out another nuclear test.And Pyongyang has made notable improvements in the solid fuels used for shorter- and longer-range missiles. Because solid fuels can be stored in the field for weeks at a time, US officials are concerned the improved technology will allow North Korea to move its missiles around and hide them from foreign surveillance more easily.“Their increasing and continual launching of missile tests — that I think is the most concerning part,” the senior defense official said. “I worry about errant missiles going off to potentially hit a populated area. Even if not deliberate, that’s an action that could be devastating.”© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.'],\n",
       "  ['It’s an important new phase of, when the early contests are over and voters from multiple states cast ballots in primaries timed to occur on the same date.It’s called “Super Tuesday,” and it is important even though neither Democratic President Joe Biden nor former President Donald Trump has had to sweat the competition this year. Primaries on Tuesday may offer the final opportunity for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s quixotic and lackluster effort to challenge Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.Instead of a single primary or caucus, Super Tuesday lumps together 15 contests for Republicans and 16 contests for Democrats spread across the country.More than a third ofare at stake along with an equally large portion of Democratic delegates. Biden is undefeated in primary contests this year, and Trump has lost only one.A large sample of the country will have contests on Super Tuesday – red states and blue states from the North, South, East and West.The primaries at stake include the first three states in the alphabet, as any schoolkid should be able to tell you: Alabama, Alaska (for Republicans) and Arkansas. In addition, there are California and Colorado; Maine, Massachusetts and Minnesota; North Carolina; Oklahoma; Tennessee and Texas; Utah; and Vermont and Virginia.Tuesday also marks the end of Democrats’ mail-in presidential preference process in Iowa, and a Democratic caucus in American Samoa.In 2016, Super Tuesday was the moment when Trump really seized control of the Republican primary. Trump won seven of the 11 contests that day, although he lost the largest prize, Texas. There was still a spirited race for delegates in 2016, as opposed to this year, when Trump has won nearly every contest before Super Tuesday and has a growing delegate lead over Haley.In 2020, Biden won 10 of 14 contests on Super Tuesday. He has not faced any serious competition from Democrats this year and is expected, as is traditional for incumbents, to win every contest Tuesday.For Republicans, the question is whether Haley can gain any traction. She has won only one contest – the primary in Washington, DC,. She is falling far behind in terms of delegates, but Haley insists that Republicans deserve a second option.Barring some unforeseen eruption of support for Haley, will a setback on Super Tuesday push her out of the race?For Democrats, Biden is coming off a. He won the Democratic primary there easily, but more than 100,000 Democratic primary voters chose “uncommitted” rather than Biden. “Uncommitted” won two of Michigan’s delegates, the only delegates Biden has lost so far.As the Palestinian, the Democratic primary voters in a state with a strong Arab American and Muslim population were protesting the president’s Israel policy and want him to push much more forcefully for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Are there signs of more protest on Super Tuesday?Meanwhile, neither of the Democrats challenging Biden has gained much traction. Rep. Dean Phillips has failed to get out of the single digits in states where Biden has campaigned. One former, fringe rival, Marianne Williamson, has actually taken the unusual step of unsuspending her campaign.Not technically on Super Tuesday. Neither candidate can win a majority of the delegates until later in March, with both candidates likely to pass the “magic number” on March 12 or March 19.Trump will need to win 1,215 of 2,429 delegates, while Biden needs 1,968 out of 3,934 delegates.Regardless,until early June. Conventions don’t take place until July for Republicans and August for Democrats.The modern primary system has only grown up in recent decades. Super Tuesday has grown with it. The term was first. Democrats in Southern states, wanting a moderate candidate, timed their primaries for. It has not always achieved that goal.Then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, a liberal, largely put the 1988 Democratic primary away with victories on Super Tuesday. In 1992, however, then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton completed his comeback by sweeping Southern states on Super Tuesday that year.In 2008, 21 states held contests on a Super Tuesday in early February, an example of front-loading the primaries. But then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton split the delegates among Democrats. Sen. John McCain decisively pushed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney from the GOP race.© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.']],\n",

      "It’s an important new phase of, when the early contests are over and voters from multiple states cast ballots in primaries timed to occur on the same date.It’s called “Super Tuesday,” and it is important even though neither Democratic President Joe Biden nor former President Donald Trump has had to sweat the competition this year. Primaries on Tuesday may offer the final opportunity for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s quixotic and lackluster effort to challenge Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.Instead of a single primary or caucus, Super Tuesday lumps together 15 contests for Republicans and 16 contests for Democrats spread across the country.More than a third ofare at stake along with an equally large portion of Democratic delegates. Biden is undefeated in primary contests this year, and Trump has lost only one.A large sample of the country will have contests on Super Tuesday – red states and blue states from the North, South, East and West.The primaries at stake include the first three states in the alphabet, as any schoolkid should be able to tell you: Alabama, Alaska (for Republicans) and Arkansas. In addition, there are California and Colorado; Maine, Massachusetts and Minnesota; North Carolina; Oklahoma; Tennessee and Texas; Utah; and Vermont and Virginia.Tuesday also marks the end of Democrats’ mail-in presidential preference process in Iowa, and a Democratic caucus in American Samoa.In 2016, Super Tuesday was the moment when Trump really seized control of the Republican primary. Trump won seven of the 11 contests that day, although he lost the largest prize, Texas. There was still a spirited race for delegates in 2016, as opposed to this year, when Trump has won nearly every contest before Super Tuesday and has a growing delegate lead over Haley.In 2020, Biden won 10 of 14 contests on Super Tuesday. He has not faced any serious competition from Democrats this year and is expected, as is traditional for incumbents, to win every contest Tuesday.For Republicans, the question is whether Haley can gain any traction. She has won only one contest – the primary in Washington, DC,. She is falling far behind in terms of delegates, but Haley insists that Republicans deserve a second option.Barring some unforeseen eruption of support for Haley, will a setback on Super Tuesday push her out of the race?For Democrats, Biden is coming off a. He won the Democratic primary there easily, but more than 100,000 Democratic primary voters chose “uncommitted” rather than Biden. “Uncommitted” won two of Michigan’s delegates, the only delegates Biden has lost so far.As the Palestinian, the Democratic primary voters in a state with a strong Arab American and Muslim population were protesting the president’s Israel policy and want him to push much more forcefully for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Are there signs of more protest on Super Tuesday?Meanwhile, neither of the Democrats challenging Biden has gained much traction. Rep. Dean Phillips has failed to get out of the single digits in states where Biden has campaigned. One former, fringe rival, Marianne Williamson, has actually taken the unusual step of unsuspending her campaign.Not technically on Super Tuesday. Neither candidate can win a majority of the delegates until later in March, with both candidates likely to pass the “magic number” on March 12 or March 19.Trump will need to win 1,215 of 2,429 delegates, while Biden needs 1,968 out of 3,934 delegates.Regardless,until early June. Conventions don’t take place until July for Republicans and August for Democrats.The modern primary system has only grown up in recent decades. Super Tuesday has grown with it. The term was first. Democrats in Southern states, wanting a moderate candidate, timed their primaries for. It has not always achieved that goal.Then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, a liberal, largely put the 1988 Democratic primary away with victories on Super Tuesday. In 1992, however, then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton completed his comeback by sweeping Southern states on Super Tuesday that year.In 2008, 21 states held contests on a Super Tuesday in early February, an example of front-loading the primaries. But then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton split the delegates among Democrats. Sen. John McCain decisively pushed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney from the GOP race.© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.\n"
